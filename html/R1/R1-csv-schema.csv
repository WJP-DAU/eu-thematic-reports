introduction,introduction,"The rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the European Union (EU) is founded and represents a constitutional priority shared by all Member States (Article 2 of the Treaty on EU). The rule of law is essential for the proper functioning of democratic societies and the protection of human rights. Furthermore, the rule of law plays a pivotal role in shaping the potential for sustainable regional growth and development.

Adherence to this principle requires effective democratic institutions that ensure public accountability and the separation of powers. It also mandates access to independent and impartial courts that protect people's fundamental rights and guarantee equality before the law. Upholding the rule of law further requires implementing targeted, evidence-informed strategies at both national and subnational levels, which are tailored to meet the diverse needs of people across different regions.

In this context, World Justice Project EUROVOICES provides new data that captures the perceptions and experiences of people living in 110 subnational regions across the 27 EU Member States in the areas of justice, democratic governance, and the rule of law. The report series draws upon surveys responses from more than 8,000 local and independent legal experts, as well as regionally representative household surveys administered to more than 64,000 respondents across the EU. With this data, the World Justice Project (WJP) seeks to contribute to evidence-based decision-making at all government levels by helping decision-makers identify strengths, weaknesses, and policy priorities in their regions.

This data is organized into three **thematic reports**: 

1. Democracy and Fundamental Rights
2. Justice and Safety
3. Transparency and Corruption
  
Each report focuses on a selection of pillars of the rule of law, comprised of indicators that cover specific dimensions of each concept. Findings for each indicator are categorized into **Expert Scorecards**, calculated using expert survey responses, and **People’s Voices**, highlighting complementary question-level data from WJP’s household surveys. These two categories are presented side-by-side, offering a comprehensive view of how EU residents perceive and experience justice, governance, and the rule of law in their respective regions.  

The Expert Scorecard captures legal experts’ assessments of composite indicators with scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest possible score and 0 is the lowest possible score. Each score is calculated by aggregating a set of questions that are relevant to various dimensions of the concept being measured. This expert data allows a deeper examination of the technical aspects that determine how people interact with a complex network of institutions and the justice system. In contrast, findings from the People’s Voices database, presented at the question level using percentages (0 to 100%), reflect the beliefs and experiences of the general population.  
  
The project’s conceptual framework builds upon the tested and proven methodology of the WJP Rule of Law Index®—a rigorous quantitative tool that evaluates and ranks 142 countries across key dimensions of the rule of law— with adaptations to reflect the institutional architecture in the EU. It should be noted that the results of both tools are not comparable, because this project presents data from its household surveys separately from its Expert Scorecards, whereas the Index integrates the General Population Poll into each country’s aggregate scores. Additionally, adjustments have been made to the conceptual framework and to the data analysis protocol, including changes in the methods used to calculate scores. For more information on the methodology of World Justice Project EUROVOICES, refer to the methodology section at the end of this report. 

Given the diversity of institutional design across EU Member States, the questions in this project’s surveys mainly focus on the outcomes experienced by individuals concerning different issues related to justice, governance, and rule of law. These outcomes result from their interactions with a complex network of institutions at local, national, and supranational levels. In this sense, the questionnaires minimized references to government institutions, focusing instead on the perceptions and experiences of people in the city, town, or village where they live. Regional information was produced following the framework of territorial divisions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system.

This project is funded by the EU and complements other research activities conducted by the WJP with the mission of advancing the rule of law worldwide. This data may also complement other monitoring tools that aim to promote a rule of law culture and enhance economic, social, and territorial cohesion in the EU, such as the European Commission’s yearly Rule of Law Report, and the EU Justice Scoreboard, and the Cohesion Report, among others.

### About this Report

This report, Democracy and Fundamental Rights, includes four chapters: (I) **Checks on government power**, (II) **Government respect for checks on power**, (III) **Civic participation**, and (IV) **Fundamental rights**. Each chapter contains thematic findings, definitions for each indicator included, and graphs depicting both expert and household responses (Expert Scorecard and People’s Voices, respectively).

1. **_Checks on government power_**: In a society where the rule of law prevails, those in positions of authority within public institutions are held accountable for their actions. This requires a robust constitutional framework that not only reviews the legality of the exercise of power but also ensures that those in power face appropriate legal consequences for misconduct. This chapter outlines the functioning of the basic political accountability mechanisms that constrain government power in democratic settings, encompassing indicators on (1) legislative oversight, (2) judicial independence, (3) independent oversight, (4) independent prosecution, (5) free, fair, and secure elections, and (6) non-governmental checks. These indicators collectively assess the effectiveness of the structures in place to ensure that government actions are checked and balanced by legal standards.

2. **_Government respect for checks on power_**: The effectiveness of the democratic checks, as discussed in Chapter 1, is key to ensuring democratic governance. This chapter addresses evolving challenges to these mechanisms, namely focusing on whether they are compromised or undermined by the executive branch. The indicators measure the extent to which the head of government respects these established democratic controls, including respect for (1) the constitution and political opponents, (2) judicial independence, (3) independent oversight, (4) independent prosecution, (5) the electoral system, and (6) civil liberties.

3. **_Civic participation_**: A pluralistic decision-making process is not limited to the operation of electoral procedures; it must also consider the continuous participation of the public. At its foundational level, civic participation entails keeping the public informed about government actions. More substantive engagement includes public consultations and open parliament practices, which contribute to decision-making processes, whether these contributions are binding or advisory. The most integrated level of civic participation involves the public in the co-creation of public policies. This is reflected in one composite indicator, (1) civic participation, measuring the extent to which governments collaborate with civil society in policy design and the degree to which local governments consider public input in their decisions. 

4. **_Fundamental rights_**: The integrity of democratic institutions is closely linked to respect and protection of fundamental rights. Specifically, the fundamental freedoms of assembly and association, and opinion and expression, constitute a central accountability mechanism in a democratic context. This chapter includes information on people's perceptions and experiences regarding the enjoyment of 21 fundamental rights defined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. For analytical coherence, some of these rights have been grouped into 14 broader categories: (1) prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment, (2) prohibition of slavery and forced labor, (3) freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, (4) freedom of peaceful assembly and association, (5) freedom of opinion and expression, (6) right to property, (7) right to asylum, (8) equality before the law, (9) workers’ rights, (10) right to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections, (11) right of access to documents, (12) right to petition, (13) right of movement and of residence, and (14) due process of law.",,

methodology,methodological,"The production of World Justice Project EUROVOICES can be summarized in the following stages:

### Conceptual design

To develop a comprehensive methodological framework, WJP first defined the observable outcomes of a society’s adherence to the rule of law and the ways rule of law impacts people’s everyday lives. Building upon the proven methodology of the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index®, the team focused the conceptual design of EUROVOICES on capturing people’s perceptions and experiences of justice, governance, and the rule of law in their daily lives. 

The team then conducted an extensive literature review and held consultations with experts from various sectors (including academia and international organizations) to adapt the project’s methodology to the current reality and challenges faced by the European Union. The resulting framework defines 51 rule of law indicators organized into ten pillars: 1) constraints on government powers; 2) government respect for constraints on power; 3) civic participation; 4) fundamental rights; 5) civil justice; 6) criminal justice; 7) safety; 8) control of corruption; 9) transparency and access to information; and 10) administrative proceedings and regulatory enforcement. 

Once these pillars and indicators were established, WJP drafted survey questions measure different aspects of each conceptual category included in the framework. This process resulted in a selection of 610 expert survey questions and 330 general population survey questions. To maintain reasonable survey length and improve response rates, the expert questions were organized into four separate questionnaires (one on criminal justice, two on civil and commercial justice, and one on governance).

### Data collection

World Justice Project EUROVOICES presents original survey data from two sources: expert surveys and household surveys.

#### Expert Surveys

Expert survey data collection for the EUROVOICES project was conducted by the WJP’s research team. The surveys were administered online between October 2023 and April 2024 using Alchemer, a user-friendly and highly secure survey administration platform. The expert surveys were administered in twelve languages: Bulgarian, Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish.

The expert survey respondents, representing the 110 subnational regions across all 27 EU Member States, included independent legal practitioners and academics selected from directories of law firms, universities and colleges, research organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as through referrals from the WJP global network of practitioners. All expert respondents were vetted by WJP staff to ensure their qualifications.

Over the course of QRQ data collection, WJP’s research team regularly sent survey invitations and reminder emails to potential respondents using publicly available online contact information, collected through a systematic review of the websites of law firms, bar associations, universities, and other organizations. To expand WJP’s network of expert respondents in the EU, the research team collaborated with local organizations and firms to identify and invite potential participants. As a result of this exercise, WJP’s team generated a database with contact information for more than 250,000 experts. In total, the WJP team obtained a total of 8,042 expert survey responses.

#### Household Surveys

Household survey data collection was conducted by leading local polling companies. The survey was translated into over 20 local languages, adapted to common local expressions, and administered in pilot tests in each country.  After conducting, reviewing, and validating the pilot tests, the survey was administered to respondents in 110 regions of the 27 EU Member States, using both face-to-face (in 10 countries) and online (in 17 countries) polling methodologies. Survey respondents in each country were selected through a probability sampling method that ensures representativeness based on age, sex, income level, and degree of urbanization. During the full-fieldwork stage of data collection, which took place between December 2023 and April 2024, a total of 64,089 EU residents were surveyed.

#### Selecting Territorial Units

For the purposes of the EUROVOICES project, WJP selected territorial units based on the EU’s Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system, resulting in 110 regions for analysis. These regions are a combination of NUTS level 1 and NUTS level 2 regions, with some adjustments for Czechia (merging 8 regions into 4), Finland (combining 5 regions into 4), and France (dropping the overseas territories). The complete list of regions is presented in the annex.

### Data analysis

Household survey responses were processed into a database that displays question-level results by collapsing the two most positive options on a four-level Likert scale in each case (e.g., strongly agree and agree, very likely and likely, among others, depending on the response scale of the question and the options that represent the most positive outcome). This data can be disaggregated by age group, sex, income, and degree of urbanization.

The expert survey data was calculated into scores using the following steps: first, the survey responses were normalized and codified into numeric values on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the highest possible score; second, the data was mapped into the pillars and indicators, as defined in the conceptual framework; and third, the normalized data was aggregated at the NUTS and country levels using simple averages. The complete variable map detailing which questions from the expert surveys were aggregated into each score can be downloaded at link.

For both the household and the expert surveys, the respondent-level data was edited to exclude partially completed surveys, suspicious data, and outliers (which were detected using the Z-score method).

A series of quantitative and qualitative tests were conducted to identify biases and errors. The first process was a quantitative cross-check in which results were systematically compared to selected indicators from trusted third-party sources, including other organizations' measurement projects, such as the V-Dem Dataset by the V-Dem Institute, and the Quality of Government database by the University of Gothenburg; and official indicator systems, such as Eurobarometer surveys and the EU Justice Scoreboard. 
In addition, three qualitative information tools were developed to test the data across all EU Member States: a compendium of news stories collected from diverse sources across the EU; syntheses of information from national and international reports published by peer organizations; and semi-structured interviews with over 30 EU experts. These tools allowed WJP to enrich the survey data with trends, issues, improvements, and regional differences in a variety of rule of law topics and contextualize the survey results.
As a result of this work, World Justice Project EUROVOICES presents a library of people-centered indicators with new data on justice, governance, and the rule of law in the EU, at both the regional and national level. Data from the expert surveys is presented at the indicator level, while household survey data is presented at the question level, with options to disaggregate by different socioeconomic and demographic variables. This data is presented in different formats, including thematic reports with maps and graphs, interactive dashboards, and databases available for download. This information allows region-to-region comparisons, detecting relative strengths and weaknesses, and identifying best practices and policies that can become reference points.

### Additional Considerations

#### Comparisons with the WJP Rule of Law Index

The results of World Justice Project EUROVOICES cannot be directly compared to the WJP Rule of Law Index® for several reasons. First, the Index scores are calculated by aggregating three sources of information: expert surveys, household surveys, and third-party data. In contrast, EUROVOICES presents findings in two separate categories: the Expert Scorecards, comprised of aggregated expert data, and People’s Voices, which displays question-level data from the household surveys.

Second, although the WJP Rule of Law Index and EUROVOICES both use the Min-Max method to normalize expert data (so that all values are presented on a scale of 0 to 1), the Index’s longitudinal analysis requires an extra normalization (with a base year of 2015) to ensure scores are comparable across previous editions of the report.

Lastly, while EUROVOICES builds upon the Index’s methodology, the two projects have distinct conceptual frameworks. Key differences include the internal organization of the pillars, the inclusion of new questions to assess independent checks on government powers, a new category on the executive’s behavior towards constraints on its power, the expansion of the chapter on fundamental rights based on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the separation of the transparency and civic participation pillars.

#### Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses

All information tools have advantages and limitations that need to be considered when using them, and World Justice Project EUROVOICES is no exception. This project organizes its findings into clearly defined indicators that allow for the easy and efficient interpretation of multi-dimensional rule of law definition. Moreover, WJP’s output-oriented approach facilitates comparisons between countries and subnationally.

However, this accessibility does require WJP to consolidate the unique and complicated realities different individuals experience into coherent findings at the national and regional levels. As such, interpretation of the data presented in this report requires a familiarity with the project’s basic conceptual framework, including WJP’s definitions for each indicator and explanations regarding which topics are and are not included in our findings.

Likewise, these indicators do not establish causality or contextualize the findings. Thus, it will be necessary to use the EUROVOICES reports in combination with other analytical tools to provide a full picture of causes and potential solutions.

Additionally, the information presented on these indicators may be sensitive to specific events that took place during the data collection period or may be subject to measurement errors due in part to the limited number of experts interviewed in some regions.
