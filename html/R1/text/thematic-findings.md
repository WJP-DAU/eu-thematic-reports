# Thematic Findings

## 1. Checks on Government Power

- Confidence in judicial independence varies widely across the European Union, and is
strongest in Finland, Denmark, and Estonia. Among legal experts, Poles judge their
courts’ independence the most negatively. Among the general population, Bulgarians
have the least faith that judges decide cases independently.

effective across the European Union and people feel free to protest. Hungary is the
only country where most people don’t feel free to participate in peaceful protests.
