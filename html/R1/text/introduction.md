# Introduction

The rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the European Union (EU) is
founded and represents a constitutional priority shared by all Member States (Article 2 of the
Treaty on EU). The rule of law is essential for the well-functioning of democratic societies and
the protection of human rights. Furthermore, the rule of law plays a pivotal role in shaping
the potential for sustainable regional growth and development.
Adherence to this principle requires the proper functioning of democratic institutions that
ensure public accountability and the separation of powers. It also mandates access to
independent and impartial courts that protect people's fundamental rights and guarantee
equality before the law. Upholding the rule of law further requires implementing targeted,
evidence-informed strategies at both national and subnational levels, which are tailored to
the needs of people across different regions, thus leaving no one behind.
In this context, World Justice Project EUROVOICES provides new data that captures the
perceptions and experiences of people living in 110 subnational regions across the 27 EU
Member States in the areas of justice, democratic governance, and the rule of law. It is based
on surveys to more than 8,000 local and independent legal experts, as well as household
surveys to more than 64,000 respondents. With this data, the World Justice Project (WJP)
seeks to contribute to evidence-based decision-making at all government levels and help
decision-makers identify strengths, weaknesses, and policy priorities in their regions.
This data is organized into three thematic reports:
(1) Democracy & Fundamental Rights
(2) Justice & Safety
(3) Transparency & Corruption

Each report contains indicators calculated using the responses of the expert surveys (Expert
Scorecard) and complemented with question-level data from WJP’s household surveys
(People’s Voices). The findings from these surveys are presented side-by-side, offering a
comprehensive view of how EU residents perceive and experience justice, governance, and
the rule of law in their respective regions.
The Expert Scorecard captures legal experts’ assessments of composite indicators with
scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest possible score and 0 is the lowest possible
score. Each score is calculated by aggregating a set of questions that touch on various
dimensions of the concept being measured. Through expert surveys, it is possible to probe
more deeply into technical aspects of how people interact with a complex network of
institutions and the justice system. In contrast, the data from the People’s Voices database,
presented at the question-level using percentages (0 to 100%), reflect the beliefs and
experiences of the general population.

The project’s conceptual framework was designed building upon the tested and proven
methodology of the WJP Rule of Law Index® — a rigorous quantitative tool that evaluates and
ranks 142 countries across key dimensions of the rule of law — with adaptations to reflect
the institutional architecture in the EU. It should be noted that the results of both tools are
not comparable, because this project presents data from the general population poll
separately, whereas the Index integrates it into the aggregate scores. In addition,
adjustments have been made to the conceptual framework and to the analysis of the data,
including changes in the methods used to calculate scores. For more information on the
methodology of World Justice Project EUROVOICES, refer to the methodology section at the
end of this report.

Given the diversity of institutional designs across EU Member States, the questions in this
project’s surveys mainly focus on the outcomes experienced by individuals concerning
different issues related to justice, governance, and rule of law. These outcomes result from
their interactions with a complex network of institutions at local, national, and supranational
levels. In this sense, the questionnaires minimized references to government institutions,
focusing instead on the perceptions and experiences of people in the city, town, or village
where they live. Regional information was produced following the framework of territorial
divisions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system.

This project is funded by the EU and complements other research activities conducted by
the WJP with the mission of advancing the rule of law worldwide. This data may also
complement other monitoring tools that aim to promote a rule of law culture and enhance
economic, social, and territorial cohesion in the EU, such as the European Commission’s
yearly Rule of Law Report, and the EU Justice Scoreboard, and the Cohesion Report, among
others. 

This report (“Democracy and Fundamental Rights”) includes four chapters: (1) Checks on
government power, (2) Government respect for checks on power, (3) Civic participation,
and (4) Fundamental rights. Each chapter contains thematic findings, definitions for each
indicator included, and graphs depicting both expert and household responses (Expert
Scorecard and People’s Voices, respectively).

1. **Checks on government power**: In a society where the rule of law prevails, those in
positions of authority within public institutions are held accountable for their
actions. This requires a robust constitutional framework that not only reviews the
legality of the exercise of power but also ensures that those in power face appropriate
legal consequences for misconduct. This chapter outlines the functioning of the
basic political accountability mechanisms that constrain government power in
democratic settings, encompassing indicators on (1) legislative oversight, (2) judicial
independence, (3) independent oversight, (4) independent prosecution, (5) free, fair,
and secure elections, and (6) non-governmental checks. These indicators
collectively assess the effectiveness of the structures in place to ensure that
government actions are checked and balanced by legal standards.


2. **Government respect for checks on power**: The effectiveness of the democratic
checks, as discussed in Chapter 1, is key to ensuring democratic governance. This
chapter addresses evolving challenges to these mechanisms, namely focusing on
whether they are compromised or undermined by the executive branch. The
indicators measure the extent to which the head of government respects these
established democratic controls, including respect for (1) the constitution and
political opponents, (2) judicial independence, (3) independent oversight, (4)
independent prosecution, (5) the electoral system, and (6) civil liberties.


3. **Civic participation**: A pluralistic decision-making process is not limited to the
operation of electoral procedures; it must also consider the continuous participation
of the public. At its foundational level, civic participation entails keeping the public
informed about government actions. More substantive engagement includes public
consultations and open parliament practices, which contribute to decision-making
processes, whether these contributions are binding or advisory. The most integrated
level of civic participation involves the public in the co-creation of public policies.
This is reflected in one composite indicator, (1) civic participation, measuring the
extent to which governments collaborate with civil society in policy design and the
degree to which local governments consider public input in their decisions.

4. **Fundamental rights**: The integrity of democratic institutions is closely linked to
respect and protection of fundamental rights. Specifically, the fundamental
freedoms of assembly and association, and opinion and expression, constitute a
central accountability mechanism in a democratic context. This chapter includes
information on people's perceptions and experiences regarding the enjoyment of 21
fundamental rights defined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union. For analytical coherence, some of these rights have been grouped into 14
broader categories: (1) prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment, (2) prohibition
of slavery and forced labor, (3) freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, (4)
freedom of peaceful assembly and association, (5) freedom of opinion and
expression, (6) right to property, (7) right to asylum, (8) equality before the law, (9)
workers’ rights, (10) right to vote and to stand as a candidate at elections, (11) right of
access to documents, (12) right to petition, (13) right of movement and of residence,
and (14) due process of law.
