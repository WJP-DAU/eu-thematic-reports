introduction,introduction,"The rule of law is one of the common values upon which the European Union (EU) is founded and represents a constitutional priority shared by all Member States (Article 2 of the Treaty on EU). Adherence to this principle requires the proper functioning of democratic institutions of governance that enable the authorities to be accountable for their actions, as well as equal access to justice in impartial courts that protect people's fundamental rights. The rule of law's construction and maintenance requires specific and evidence-informed solutions at the national and subnational levels, considering people's views.

World Justice Project EUROVOICES provides new data that captures the perceptions and experiences of people living in 110 subnational regions across the 27 EU Member States in the areas of justice, democracy, and the rule of law. It is based on surveys to more than 8,000 local and independent legal experts, as well as household surveys to more than 64,000 respondents. With this data, the World Justice Project (WJP) seeks to contribute to evidence-based decision-making processes at all government levels and help decision makers in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and policy priorities in their regions. Regional information was produced following the framework of territorial divisions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system.

This data is organized into three **thematic reports**:

1. Democracy & Fundamental Rights [add link]
2. Justice & Safety [add link]
3. Corruption & Transparency [add link]

Each report contains a collection of indicators calculated using the responses of the expert surveys (Expert Scorecard) and complemented with question-level data from WJP's household surveys (People's Voices). The results of these two data collection methods are presented side-by-side, resulting in a comprehensive picture that portrays how people perceive and experience justice, governance, and the rule of law.

This report (“Corruption & Transparency”) includes three chapters: (1) **Control of corruption**, (2) **Transparency and access to information**, and (3) **Administrative proceedings, regulatory enforcement, and right to property**. Each chapter contains thematic findings, definitions for each indicator included, as well as graphs with data from both the expert and household surveys (Expert Scorecard and People's Voices, respectively).

1. Control of corruption: Commonly defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, corruption is an umbrella term that can be used to label a variety of acts. This pillar measures the prevalence of five types of corruption in the public sector. The first two categories reflect a classic distinction in corruption studies: the difference between petty corruption, which occurs at the street level in the form of bribes to lower-ranking public agents; and grand corruption, including political corruption and corrupt procurement practices, which distorts the decision making of high-level government officials. The remaining categories explore in detail three special types of corruption: embezzlement of public funds, favoritism, and electoral corruption.

2. Transparency and access to information: Transparency refers to the set of mechanisms that facilitate people's access to public information. In a general sense, the information included in this chapter can be grouped into two types of mechanisms: proactive and reactive transparency. Proactive transparency refers to those practices of public institutions that aim to make information of general interest available to the public in the most accessible way possible. This category includes information on the degree of publicity of the legal framework, the generation and dissemination of information on people's rights, and the publication of reasoning and justifications for decisions of public interest. In contrast, reactive transparency refers to the mechanisms by which a public institution responds in a clear, complete and timely manner to citizen requests for public information.

3. Administrative proceedings, regulatory enforcement, and right to property: This chapter includes information on the clarity, stability, and accessibility of regulatory proceedings, specifically in the areas of trade, consumer protection, and environmental protection. Additionally, it includes information on the right to property, which is indicative of an environment where private tangible and intellectual property is protected from arbitrary expropriation. This pillar also reports on the operation of enforcement mechanisms for these regulations. Clear and stable regulations allow businesses to adequately plan their development, and efficient administrative procedures mean lower operating costs. Greater predictability in regulatory enforcement is valuable for businesses insofar as it assures that like cases will be treated equally, thus increasing business ability to plan their development. 

The Expert Scorecard captures legal experts' assessments through 49 composite indicators with scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest possible score and 0 is the lowest possible score. Each score is calculated by aggregating a set of questions that touch on various dimensions of the concept at hand. Through expert surveys, it is possible to probe more deeply into technical aspects regarding how people interact with a complex network of institutions and the justice system.  In contrast, the data from the People's Voices database is presented at the question-level and using percentages (0 to 100%), which reflect the beliefs and experiences of the general population.

The project's conceptual framework was designed building upon the tested and proven methodology of the WJP Rule of Law Index® (a rigorous quantitative tool that evaluates and ranks 142 countries across key dimensions of the rule of law), with adaptations to reflect the institutional architecture in the EU. It should be noted that the results of both tools are not directly comparable because, in this project, data from the general population poll is presented separately instead of being integrated into the aggregate scores. In addition, adjustments have been made to the conceptual framework and to the analysis of the data, including in the methods being used to calculate scores. For more information on the project's methodology, please refer to the methodology section at the end of this report [add link].

Given the diversity of institutional designs across EU Member States, the questions included in our survey instruments mainly focus on outcomes experienced by individuals with respect to different justice, governance, and rule of law issues, with the understanding that these outcomes are generated by their interaction with a complex network of institutions from different levels (local, national, supranational). In this sense, we minimized mentions of government institutions, and instead focused on the perceptions and experiences of people in the city, town, or village where they live.

This project is funded by the EU and complements other research activities being conducted by the WJP with the mission of advancing the rule of law worldwide. This data may also complement other monitoring tools that aim to promote a rule of law culture in the EU, including the European Commission's yearly Rule of Law Report and the EU Justice Scoreboard, among others.",,

ch08,chapter,# Control of corruption,,
ch08_f,findings,"- The prevalence of grand corruption, including corrupt public procurement practices and political graft, is a more pressing concern in the EU than street-level corruption, such as bribery in public services. The EU average score for the first type of corruption is 0.74 while for the second it is 0.53, on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies the highest possible score.
- People in the EU perceive a much higher level of corruption among political parties and members of the legislature than among national government officials, local government officials, and the police. However, there is considerable variation in the level of concern. In Sweden, only 5% of people think that police officers are corrupt, while in Romania, Bulgaria, and Cyprus the figure exceeds 30%.
- The efficacy of anti-corruption measures is being called into question. In all Member States, the majority of respondents believe that the measures taken by the national governments are ineffective in combating corruption and that these measures are not applied impartially.",ch08,

f_sec8_1,html,"This indicator explores the prevalence of bribes in administrative procedures and interactions with the police and court personnel. It assesses whether individuals in those situations have to make informal payments or gifts to receive a public service or expedite a process.

- The average score for the expert indicator of absence of bribery across the 27 EU Member States is 0.74 (Figure 8.1). Scores range from 0.98 in Denmark to 0.46 in Bulgaria.
- In all 27 Member States, fewer than half of respondents from the general population agree that their national government's efforts to combat corruption are effective (Figure 8.1.16) and that measures against corruption are applied impartially and without ulterior motives (Figure 8.1.17).
- In 5 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that they are personally affected by corruption in their daily lives, figures range from just 10.9% in Denmark to 68.6% in Cyprus (Figure 8.1.14).
- Perceptions of corruption in government institutions are the highest regarding political parties; in 17 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all political parties are involved in corrupt practices (Figure 8.1.10). Following that, in 9 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all Members of Parliament/Congress are corrupt (Figure 8.1.1), and in 6 Member States, the majority believe most or all officials in the national government are corrupt (Figure 8.1.2). On the contrary, perceptions of corruption are the lowest across the EU regarding car registration officers (Figure 8.1.9), land registry officers (Figure 8.1.8), and police officers (Figure 8.1.7).",sec8_1,

about,about,"**The World Justice Project (WJP)** is an independent, multidisciplinary organization working to create knowledge, build awareness, and stimulate action to advance the rule of law worldwide. Effective rule of law is the foundation for communities of justice, opportunity, and peace–underpinning development, accountable government, and respect for fundamental rights.

The WJP builds and supports a global, multidisciplinary movement for the rule of law through three lines of work: collecting, organizing, and analyzing original, independent rule of law data, including the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index; supporting research, scholarship, and teaching about the importance of the rule of law, its relationship to development, and effective strategies to strengthen it; and connecting and building an engaged global network of policymakers and advocates to advance the rule of law through strategic partnerships, convenings, coordinated advocacy, and support for locally led initiatives.
