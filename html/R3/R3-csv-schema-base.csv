ch1,chapter,# Control of Corruption,,
23,findings,"- The prevalence of grand corruption, including corrupt public procurement practices and political graft, is a more pressing concern in the EU than street-level corruption, such as bribery in public services. The EU average score for the first type of corruption is 0.74 while for the second it is 0.53, on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies the highest possible score.
- People in the EU perceive a much higher level of corruption among political parties and members of the legislature than among national government officials, local government officials, and the police. However, there is considerable variation in the level of concern. In Sweden, only 5% of people think that police officers are corrupt, while in Romania, Bulgaria, and Cyprus the figure exceeds 30%.
- The efficacy of anti-corruption measures is being called into question. In all Member States, the majority of respondents believe that the measures taken by the national governments are ineffective in combating corruption and that these measures are not applied impartially.
Commonly defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, corruption is a flexible term that can be used to label very diverse acts. This pillar measures the prevalence of five types of acts of corruption in the public sector. The first two categories reflect a classic distinction in corruption studies: the difference between petty corruption, which occurs at the street level in the form of bribes to lower-ranking public agents; and grand corruption, including political corruption and corrupt procurement practices, which distorts the decision making of high-level government officials. The remaining categories explore in detail three special types of corruption: embezzlement of public funds, favoritism, and electoral corruption.",ch1,

25,html,"This indicator explores the prevalence of bribes in administrative procedures and interactions with the police and court personnel. It assesses whether individuals in those situations have to make informal payments or gifts to receive a public service or expedite a process.

- The average score for the expert indicator of absence of bribery across the 27 EU Member States is 0.74 (Figure 8.1). Scores range from 0.98 in Denmark to 0.46 in Bulgaria.

- In all 27 Member States, fewer than half of respondents from the general population agree that their national government's efforts to combat corruption are effective (Figure 8.1.16) and that measures against corruption are applied impartially and without ulterior motives (Figure 8.1.17). 
                                                                                                      
- In 5 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that they are personally affected by corruption in their daily lives, figures range from just 10.9% in Denmark to 68.6% in Cyprus (Figure 8.1.14).   

- Perceptions of corruption in government institutions are the highest regarding political parties; in 17 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all political parties are involved in corrupt practices (Figure 8.1.10). Following that, in 9 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all Members of Parliament/Congress are corrupt (Figure 8.1.1), and in 6 Member States, the majority believe most or all officials in the national government are corrupt (Figure 8.1.2). On the contrary, perceptions of corruption are the lowest across the EU regarding car registration officers (Figure 8.1.9), land registry officers (Figure 8.1.8), and police officers (Figure 8.1.7).",24,

56,appendix,"To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in thisreport is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected bythe World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizensconcerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework intheir country.

The General Population Poll used to collect data in South America in 2022 features several new questionsthat highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, policeperformance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 124perception-based questions and 85 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic informationon all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Colombia was administered to a sample of 1,000 respondents.

**Data Collection**

The GPP in Colombia was conducted for the WJP’s The Rule of Law in Colombia: Key Findings from theGeneral Population Poll 2022 with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by Tempo Group, based inBogotá, Colombia. Tempo Group administered the surveys between May and June 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage random sampling design. The target population group for this surveyincluded Colombians aged 18 years or older residing across 18 cities throughout the country.

**SAMPLE SIZE & SAMPLE FRAME**

The General Population Poll in Colombia represents an achieved total sample size of 1,000 interviewsdistributed proportionally across all three regions. Tempo Group based the sampling frame on the 2022projected population figures from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), acquiring aproportionally stratified sample by department, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Projectsplit three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned oneoption to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, CivicParticipation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. Alink to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

**SAMPLING**

Regions and cities were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Within cities,neighborhood blocks were selected using probability proportional to size sampling. In rural areas, veredazones, or sub-municipalities, were selected using probability proportional to size sampling. Each samplingunit was then selected randomly, and 6 interviews were assigned to each unit. Within the sampled segments,survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used a Kish grid toselect respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet thecharacteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

Challenges to data collection included security issues and accessibility in rural areas although ultimately, nosample units were substituted.",,
