# Methodological Materials

The production of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* can be summarized in the following stages:

### Conceptual Design

To develop a comprehensive methodological framework, WJP first defined the observable outcomes of a society’s adherence to the rule of law and the ways rule of law impacts people’s everyday lives. Building upon the proven methodology of the *World Justice Project Rule of Law Index®*, the team focused the conceptual design of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* on capturing people’s perceptions and experiences of justice, governance, and the rule of law in their daily lives. 

The team then conducted an extensive literature review and held consultations with experts from various sectors (including academia and international organizations) to adapt the project’s methodology to the current reality and challenges faced by the European Union. The resulting framework defines 51 rule of law indicators organized into ten pillars: 1) constraints on government powers; 2) government respect for constraints on power; 3) civic participation; 4) fundamental rights; 5) civil justice; 6) criminal justice; 7) safety; 8) control of corruption; 9) transparency and access to information; and 10) administrative proceedings and regulatory enforcement. 

After establishing these pillars and indicators, WJP drafted survey questions to measure different aspects of each conceptual category included in the framework. This process resulted in a selection of 610 expert survey questions and 330 general population survey questions. To maintain reasonable survey length and improve response rates, the expert questions were organized into four separate questionnaires (one on criminal justice, two on civil and commercial justice, and one on governance).

### Data Collection

*World Justice Project EUROVOICES* presents original survey data from two sources: expert surveys and household surveys.

#### Expert Surveys

Expert survey data collection for *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* project was conducted by the WJP’s research team. The surveys were administered online between October 2023 and April 2024 using Alchemer, a user-friendly and highly secure survey administration platform. The expert surveys were administered in twelve languages: Bulgarian, Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish.

The expert survey respondents, representing the 110 subnational regions across all 27 EU Member States, included independent legal practitioners and academics selected from directories of law firms, universities and colleges, research organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as through referrals from the WJP global network of practitioners. All expert respondents were vetted by WJP staff to ensure their qualifications.

Over the course of the expert survey data collection, WJP’s research team regularly sent survey invitations and reminder emails to potential respondents using publicly available online contact information, collected through a systematic review of the websites of law firms, bar associations, universities, and other organizations. To expand WJP’s network of expert respondents in the EU, the research team collaborated with local organizations and firms to identify and invite potential participants. As a result of this exercise, WJP’s team generated a database with contact information for more than 250,000 experts. In total, the WJP team obtained 8,042 expert survey responses.

#### Household Surveys

Household survey data collection was conducted by leading local polling companies. The survey was translated into over 20 local languages, adapted to common local expressions, and administered in pilot tests in each country.  After conducting, reviewing, and validating the pilot tests, the survey was administered to respondents in 110 regions of the 27 EU Member States, using both face-to-face (in 10 countries) and online (in 17 countries) polling methodologies. Survey respondents in each country were selected through a probability sampling method that ensures representativeness based on age, sex, income level, and degree of urbanization. During the full-fieldwork stage of data collection, which took place between December 2023 and April 2024, a total of 64,089 EU residents were surveyed.

#### Selecting Territorial Units

For the purposes of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES*, WJP selected territorial units based on the EU’s Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system, resulting in 110 regions for analysis. These regions are a combination of NUTS level 1 and NUTS level 2 regions, with some adjustments for Czechia (merging 8 regions into 4), Finland (combining 5 regions into 4), and France (dropping the overseas territories). The complete list of regions is presented in the annex.

### Data Analysis

Household survey responses were processed into a database that displays question-level results by collapsing the two most positive options on a four-level Likert scale in each case (e.g., strongly agree and agree, very likely and likely, among others, depending on the response scale of the question and the options that represent the most positive outcome). This data can be disaggregated by age group, sex, income, and degree of urbanization.

The expert survey data was calculated into scores using the following steps: first, the survey responses were normalized and codified into numeric values on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the highest possible score; second, the data was mapped into the pillars and indicators, as defined in the conceptual framework; and third, the normalized data was aggregated at the NUTS and country levels using simple averages. The complete variable map detailing which questions from the expert surveys were aggregated into each score can be downloaded at the following link.

For both the household and the expert surveys, the respondent-level data was edited to exclude partially completed surveys, suspicious data, and outliers (which were detected using the Z-score method).

A series of quantitative and qualitative tests were conducted to identify biases and errors. The first process was a quantitative cross-check in which results were systematically compared to selected indicators from trusted third-party sources, including other organizations' measurement projects, such as the V-Dem Dataset by the V-Dem Institute, and the Quality of Government database by the University of Gothenburg; and official indicator systems, such as Eurobarometer surveys and the EU Justice Scoreboard. 
In addition, three qualitative information tools were developed to test the data across all EU Member States: a compendium of news stories collected from diverse sources across the EU; syntheses of information from national and international reports published by peer organizations; and semi-structured interviews with over 30 EU experts. These tools allowed WJP to enrich the survey data with trends, issues, improvements, and regional differences in a variety of rule of law topics and contextualize the survey results.
As a result of this work, *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* presents a library of people-centered indicators with new data on justice, governance, and the rule of law in the EU, at both the regional and national level. Data from the expert surveys is presented at the indicator level, while household survey data is presented at the question level, with options to disaggregate by different socioeconomic and demographic variables. This data is presented in different formats, including thematic reports with maps and graphs, interactive dashboards, and databases available for download. This information allows region-to-region comparisons, detecting relative strengths and weaknesses, and identifying best practices and policies that can become reference points.

### Additional Considerations

#### Comparisons with the *WJP Rule of Law Index*

The results of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* cannot be directly compared to the *WJP Rule of Law Index®* for several reasons. First, the Index scores are calculated by aggregating three sources of information: expert surveys, household surveys, and third-party data. In contrast, *EUROVOICES WJP* presents findings in two separate categories: the Expert Scorecards, comprised of aggregated expert data, and People’s Voices, which displays question-level data from the household surveys.

Second, although the *WJP Rule of Law Index* and *EUROVOICES WJP* both use the Min-Max method to normalize expert data (so that all values are presented on a scale of 0 to 1), the Index’s longitudinal analysis requires an extra normalization (with a base year of 2015) to ensure scores are comparable across previous editions of the report.

Lastly, while *EUROVOICES WJP* builds upon the Index’s methodology, the two projects have distinct conceptual frameworks. Key differences include the internal organization of the pillars, the inclusion of new questions to assess independent checks on government powers, a new category on the executive’s behavior towards constraints on its power, the expansion of the chapter on fundamental rights based on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the separation of the transparency and civic participation pillars.

#### Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses

All information tools have advantages and limitations that need to be considered when using them, and *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* is no exception. This project organizes its findings into clearly defined indicators that allow for the easy and efficient interpretation of a multi-dimensional rule of law definition. Moreover, WJP’s output-oriented approach facilitates comparisons between countries and regions.

However, this accessibility does require WJP to consolidate the unique and complicated realities different individuals experience into coherent findings at the national and regional levels. As such, interpretation of the data presented in this report requires a familiarity with the project’s basic conceptual framework, including WJP’s definitions for each indicator and explanations regarding which topics are and are not included in our findings.

Likewise, these indicators do not establish causality or contextualize the findings. Thus, it will be necessary to use the *EUROVOICES WJP* reports in combination with other analytical tools to provide a full picture of causes and potential solutions.

Additionally, the information presented on these indicators may be sensitive to specific events that took place during the data collection period or may be subject to measurement errors due in part to the limited number of experts interviewed in some regions.
