# Thematic Findings

## 8. Control of corruption

- The prevalence of grand corruption, including corrupt public procurement practices and political graft, is a more pressing concern in the EU than street-level corruption, such as bribery in public services. The EU average score for the first type of corruption is 0.74 while for the second it is 0.53, on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies the highest possible score.

However, there is considerable variation in the level of concern. In Sweden, only 5% of people think that police officers are corrupt, while in Romania, Bulgaria, and Cyprus the figure exceeds 30%.
- The efficacy of anti-corruption measures is being called into question. In all Member States, the majority of respondents believe that the measures taken by the national governments are ineffective in combating corruption and that these measures are not applied impartially. 

### 8.1 Absence of bribery

This indicator explores the prevalence of bribes in administrative procedures and interactions with the police and court personnel. It assesses whether individuals in those situations have to make informal payments or gifts to receive a public service or expedite a process.

- The average score for the expert indicator of absence of bribery across the 27 EU Member States is 0.74 (Figure 8.1). Scores range from 0.98 in Denmark to 0.46 in Bulgaria.
- In all 27 Member States, fewer than half of respondents from the general population agree that their national government's efforts to combat corruption are effective (Figure 8.1.16) and that measures against corruption are applied impartially and without ulterior motives (Figure 8.1.17).
- In 5 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that they are personally affected by corruption in their daily lives, figures range from just 10.9% in Denmark to 68.6% in Cyprus (Figure 8.1.14).

- In 14 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that local authorities provide people with information about their rights (Figure 9.1.1), and in 9 EU countries, the majority of respondents believe that local authorities provide information in a simple, easy-to-read way (Figure 9.1.2).
- In 21 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that local authorities make information easy to find online (Figure 9.1.3), yet only in 1 Member State (Poland) the majority of people agree that this information is easy to find without using the internet, such as using leaflets or posters (Figure 9.1.4).
- In 26 Member States (data was not collected in Ireland for these questions), fewer than half of respondents believe it is likely or very likely that government agencies would grant information requests related to copies of government contracts or to detailed budget figures of government agencies (Figure 9.1.5).
