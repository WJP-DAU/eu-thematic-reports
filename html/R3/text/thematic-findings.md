# Thematic Findings

## Control of corruption

- Across the EU, local legal experts say high-level corruption—including corrupt public procurement practices and political graft—is a more prevalent issue than street-level corruption.
- People in the EU believe political parties and members of the legislature are more corrupt than the police and local and national government officials. However, there is considerable variation in the level of concern between respondents of different EU Member States. In Sweden, only 5% of people think that police officers are corrupt, while at least 30% think so in Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.
- The majority of people in all EU Member States believe government actions to control corruption are ineffective and applied selectively.

### Absence of bribery

- The average score for the expert indicator of **absence of bribery** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.74 (Figure 1). Country-level scores range from 0.98 in Denmark to 0.46 in Bulgaria (graded on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies the best possible score).
- In all 27 Member States, the majority of respondents from the general population believe that their **national government's efforts to combat corruption are ineffective** (Figure 17) and that **measures against corruption are not applied impartially** (Figure 18).
- In 5 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that they are **personally affected by corruption in their daily lives** (Figure 15). At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree they are personally affected by corruption ranges from just 10.9% in Denmark to 68.6% in Cyprus.
- Compared to a selection of government institutions, perceptions of corruption are highest regarding political parties: in 17 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all **political parties are involved in corrupt practices** (Figure 11). Meanwhile, in 9 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all **members of Parliament/Congress are corrupt** (Figure 2), and in 6 Member States, the majority believe most or all **officials in the national government are corrupt** (Figure 3). In contrast, respondents across the EU report that perceptions of corruption are the lowest regarding **car registration officers** (Figure 10), **land registry officers** (Figure 9), and **police officers** (Figure 8).

### Absence of graft and corrupt procurement practices

- The average score for the expert indicator of absence of graft and corrupt procurement practices among the 27 EU Member States is 0.54 (Figure 19). Country-level scores range from 0.89 in Finland to 0.25 in Bulgaria.
- In 21 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **the only way to succeed in business is to have political connections**. At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree ranges from 19.5% in Sweden to 75.5% in Croatia (Figure 20).

### Absence of embezzlement

- The average score for the expert indicator of **absence of embezzlement** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.60 (Figure 21). Country-level scores range from 0.90 in Finland to 0.32 in Bulgaria.

### Absence of favoritism

### Absence of corrupt electoral practices

- In all 27 Member States, the vast majority of people think **it is unacceptable for an elected official to take public funds for private use** (Figure 24). At the country-level, the percentage of respondents who say corrupt practices among elected officials are unacceptable range from 97.0% in Finland to 79.1% in Romania. 
- Most people across the EU believe **it is unacceptable for a public officer to be recruited on the basis of family ties and friendship networks** (Figure 25). Figures range from 85.6% in Italy to 49.9% in Luxembourg.

## Transparency and access to information

- Perceptions of transparency vary considerably across the EU, with experts in Sweden reporting the highest levels of positivity and experts in Romania reporting the lowest.
- People lack confidence in their ability to access detailed public information from government agencies in a majority of EU countries.

### Transparency and access to information

- The average score for the expert indicator to the right of **transparency and access to information** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.67 (Figure 26). Country-level scores range from 0.83 in Sweden to 0.52 in Romania.
- In 14 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **local authorities provide people with information about their rights** (Figure 27), and in 9 EU countries, the majority of respondents believe that **local authorities provide information in a simple, easy-to-read way** (Figure 28).
- In 21 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that local authorities make **information easy to find online** (Figure 29), yet only in Poland do the majority of people agree that this **information is easy to find without using the internet** (i.e., by using leaflets or posters) (Figure 30).
- In 26 Member States (data was not collected in Ireland for these questions), fewer than half of respondents believe it is likely or very likely that **government agencies would grant information requests related to copies of government contracts or to detailed budget figures of government agencies** (Figure 31). In most Member States, people tend to agree they are more likely to be granted information on budget figures than government contracts.

## Administrative proceedings, regulatory enforcement, and right to property

- While legal experts in the EU believe business regulation is predictable and evenly enforced, they say that starting and operating a business in the EU is unnecessarily complicated.

### Simple, predictable, and timely administrative proceedings

- The average score for the expert indicator of **simple, predictable, and timely administrative proceedings** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.61 (Figure 32). Country-level scores range from 0.86 in Finland to 0.43 in Romania.

### Right to property

- The average score for the expert indicator of **right to property** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.66 (Figure 33). Country-level scores range from 0.84 in Denmark to 0.53 in Bulgaria.

### Regulatory enforcement

- The average score for the expert indicator which assesses regulatory enforcement, or the **regularity and effectiveness of audits and inspections**, among the 27 EU Member States is 0.66 (Figure 34). Country-level scores range from 0.79 in Austria to 0.46 in Malta.
