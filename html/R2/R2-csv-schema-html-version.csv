14,introduction,"The rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the European Union (EU) is founded and represents a constitutional priority shared by all Member States (Article 2 of the Treaty on EU). The rule of law is essential for the proper functioning of democratic societies and the protection of human rights. Furthermore, the rule of law plays a pivotal role in shaping the potential for sustainable regional growth and development.

Adherence to this principle requires effective democratic institutions that ensure public accountability and the separation of powers. It also mandates access to independent and impartial courts that protect people's fundamental rights and guarantee equality before the law. Upholding the rule of law further requires implementing targeted, evidence-informed strategies at both national and subnational levels, which are tailored to meet the diverse needs of people across different regions.

In this context, *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* provides new data that captures the perceptions and experiences of people living in 110 subnational regions across the 27 EU Member States in the areas of justice, democratic governance, and the rule of law. The report series draws upon surveys responses from more than 8,000 local and independent legal experts, as well as regionally representative household surveys administered to more than 64,000 respondents across the EU. With this data, the World Justice Project (WJP) seeks to contribute to evidence-based decision-making at all government levels by helping decision-makers identify strengths, weaknesses, and policy priorities in their regions.  

This data is organized into three **thematic reports**: 

1. Democracy and Fundamental Rights
2. Justice and Safety
3. Transparency and Corruption
  
Each report focuses on a selection of pillars of the rule of law, comprised of indicators that cover specific dimensions of each concept. Findings for each indicator are categorized into **Expert Scorecards**, calculated using expert survey responses, and/or **People’s Voices**, highlighting complementary question-level data from WJP’s household surveys. These two categories are presented side-by-side, offering a comprehensive view of how EU residents perceive and experience justice, governance, and the rule of law in their respective regions.  

The Expert Scorecard captures legal experts’ assessments of composite indicators with scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest possible score and 0 is the lowest possible score. Each score is calculated by aggregating a set of questions that are relevant to various dimensions of the concept being measured. This expert data allows for a deeper examination of the technical aspects that determine how people interact with a complex network of institutions and the justice system. In contrast, findings from the People’s Voices database, presented at the question level using percentages (0 to 100%), reflect the beliefs and experiences of the general population.  
  
The project’s conceptual framework builds upon the tested and proven methodology of the *WJP Rule of Law Index®*—a rigorous quantitative tool that evaluates and ranks 142 countries across key dimensions of the rule of law—with adaptations to reflect the institutional architecture in the EU. It should be noted that the results of both tools are not comparable, because this project presents data from its household surveys separately from its Expert Scorecards, whereas the Index integrates the General Population Poll into each country’s aggregate scores. Additionally, adjustments have been made to the conceptual framework and to the data analysis protocol, including changes in the methods used to calculate scores. For more information on the methodology of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES*, refer to the methodology section at the end of this report.

Given the diversity of institutional design across EU Member States, the questions in this project’s surveys mainly focus on the outcomes experienced by individuals concerning different issues related to justice, governance, and the rule of law. These outcomes result from their interactions with a complex network of institutions at local, national, and supranational levels. In this sense, the questionnaires minimized references to government institutions, focusing instead on the perceptions and experiences of people in the city, town, or village where they live. Regional information was produced following the framework of territorial divisions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system.

This project is funded by the EU and complements other research activities conducted by the WJP with the mission of advancing the rule of law worldwide. This data may also complement other monitoring tools that aim to promote a rule of law culture and enhance economic, social, and territorial cohesion in the EU, such as the European Commission’s yearly Rule of Law Report, the EU Justice Scoreboard, and the Cohesion Report, among others.

### Key Findings

**Democracy and Fundamental Rights:**

- People can vote freely: Most people in the EU agree that they can vote freely, without feeling harassed or pressured.
- Fundamental freedoms are protected: The freedoms of assembly, association, and expression are well-protected across most of the EU; however, some regions are falling short in upholding these essential rights.
- The public has doubts about judicial independence: Legal experts in most EU countries consider judicial independence to be strong, but the majority of the general population thinks judges lack independence. 
- People worry about misinformation: Most people in the EU believe senior government officials use misinformation to shape public opinion in their favor.
- Discrimination is a challenge across the EU: More than 25% of people faced discrimination during the past year in 20 EU Member States.

**Justice and Safety:**

- Most people who experienced legal problems got the advice they needed: Legal problems are ubiquitous across the EU. People facing legal problems have access to quality information and advice, and, to a lesser extent, appropriate assistance and representation.
- In general, people believe that justice is expensive: Across the EU, respondents think that most people cannot easily afford the costs of legal assistance and representation, or the costs of dispute resolution mechanisms if they face a legal problem.
- Civil justice is not timely: Across the EU, most people believe that civil and commercial courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner.
- Criminal justice is effective overall, but not all people benefit equally: Most people in the EU agree that the criminal justice system is effective and respects the rights of both victims and the accused; however, they don’t believe all people are treated equally. 

**Transparency and Corruption:**

- For the most part, people do not think the government is corrupt: Across the EU most people do not believe courts, legislatures, or other state institutions are corrupt; however, they do believe political parties are corrupt.
- Anticorruption measures are seen as ineffective: Across the EU, most people believe government actions to control corruption are ineffective.
- Authorities are transparent and provide information: Expert assessments of transparency and access to information across the EU are positive, and most people believe that local authorities provide accessible information.
- Business regulations are predictable, but businesses face red tape: Although legal experts say business regulations in the EU are predictable and evenly enforced, they note that obtaining certain permits is challenging. 

**General Trends Across Regions:**

- Governance is important for development: Across the EU, where democratic governance is stronger, so is economic development.
- People have more trust in local authorities: Public trust is higher in local authorities than in national governments across the EU, with 52% of respondents trusting local governments compared to 41% for national ones.
- Governance varies less within countries than across them: Public perceptions of the rule of law vary more between countries than across regions of the same country.
- People in urban and rural areas largely agree on justice and the rule of law, with some exceptions: Across the EU, urban and rural residents generally share similar views on issues related to justice and the rule of law, though differences emerge in specific regions, countries, population groups, and topics. 
- Gender inequality persists: Across the EU, women generally share similar views to men on justice and the rule of law but hold more negative opinions regarding gender equality in both public and private life.  

### About this Report

EUROVOICES presents two different types of indicators: Expert Scorecard and People’s Voices. The Expert Scorecard provides an aggregated score at either the subnational or national level, depending on the topic, based on data from WJP’s survey of local and independent legal experts and practitioners from different disciplines. Explore the variable map, found in the “downloads” section, with information on the individual expert survey questions that make up each aggregated score. People’s Voices presents selected question-level data from household surveys to representative samples across the EU on each topic. Additional data and sociodemographic breakdowns of the People’s Voices indicators can be explored on the EUROVOICES dashboard. For all indicators, country-level data, when presented, is calculated using weighted averages of region-level scores based on population size.

This report, Justice and Safety, consists of three chapters: (1) **Civil Justice**, (2) **Criminal Justice**, and (3) **Safety**. Each chapter contains thematic findings, definitions for each indicator included, as well as graphs with data from both the expert and household surveys (Expert Scorecard and People’s Voices, respectively).

When the rule of law prevails, both governing authorities and the people they serve respect the rights of others, contributing to a secure and just society. Additionally, people should have access to effective legal mechanisms to resolve their legal issues or seek redress for violations of their rights.
In conceptualizing safety and access to justice, WJP uses a people-centered approach, focusing on individuals’ justice journeys. This approach seeks to analytically reconstruct people’s experiences as they navigate different justice services in their quest to resolve their legal disputes. 

1. **_Civil Justice_**: The first chapter of this report focuses on civil justice, defined as the array of services and mechanisms people use to resolve non-criminal disputes, including family, labor, commercial, environmental, administrative, and financial disputes, as well as consumer issues. 

    Indicators for civil justice include (1) legal capability, (2) access to legal aid and representation in case of civil disputes, (3) accessible, appropriate, and timely dispute resolution, (4) impartial and independent dispute resolution, (5) outcome-oriented and effective dispute resolution, and (6) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. 

    To further explore these issues, the chapter concludes with new, region-specific findings from the *WJP Global Legal Needs Survey* (a special module included in the household surveys), which provides in-depth insights into the prevalence of civil and administrative legal problems and the efficacy of the justice system for resolving those problems, as experienced by individuals seeking justice.


2. **_Criminal Justice_**: Strong rule of law systems depend on the ability of impartial and independent criminal justice mechanisms to redress grievances and bring action against individuals for offenses against society. Effective criminal justice mechanisms ensure that victims of criminal acts have access to competent, prompt, and effective mechanisms for criminal investigation, prosecution, and adjudication. Moreover, these justice services must be accessible to all members of society, regardless of where they live or their personal characteristics. 

    Additionally, the criminal justice system must follow due process and uphold the rights of all involved parties, including victims, individuals accused of a crime, and persons deprived of their liberty. This chapter includes indicators on (1) effective and impartial criminal investigation, (2) effective and impartial prosecution and pre-trial proceedings, (3) effective and impartial criminal adjudication, (4) alternative criminal justice mechanisms, (5) victims’ rights, (6) due process of law, and (7) right of persons deprived of liberty.

3. **_Safety_**: Security is one of the defining aspects of any rule of law society and is a fundamental function of the state. It is also a precondition for the realization of the rights and freedoms that the rule of law seeks to advance. Thus, effective crime control and the reduction of violence are key components of the rule of law. 

    This chapter examines how well governments meet these safety objectives by focusing on two indicators from the general population poll: (1) perceptions of safety and (2) control of violence.",,

16,findings,"Outlined below are the findings for this section. First, we present the main findings for the chapter, emphasizing notable insights in the data. This is followed by summaries of individual indicators organized by topic.

- People perceive justice as being too expensive. Malta is the only EU Member State where most people agree they can easily meet the costs of turning to a state dispute resolution mechanism when they face a legal problem.
- Across the EU, most people perceive that civil and commercial courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner.
- People are not aware of their legal rights. Romania, Poland, and Greece are the only EU Member States in which the majority of respondents feel aware of their rights when facing a legal problem.
- In 15 Member States\*, a majority of respondents experienced at least one non-trivial legal problem\*\* in the past two years. The prevalence of legal problems varies widely across the EU, as just 15.6% of respondents experienced a recent legal problem in Portugal, while 71.0% did in Hungary. Across the EU, the most common legal problems were related to consumer protection.
- Most EU residents who experienced a non-trivial legal issue** and needed access to a dispute resolution mechanism did not have access to it. This finding presents a major challenge to many EU countries aiming to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target on access to justice for all (SDG 16.3.3). 

\*The module on legal needs covers 26 out of the 27 EU Member States; this data was not collected in Ireland.
\*\*We understand non-trivial legal problems as those that respondents label with a seriousness larger than or equal to 4 on a scale of 0 to 10.",15,

Across the EU, the most **commonly reported legal problems** were related to consumer protection and housing (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F20"">Figure 20</a>).    
- Among all respondents who reported experiencing non-trivial legal problems, at least half  had **access to good information and advice** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F23"">Figure 23</a>) and, in 18 Member States, the majority of respondents had **access to adequate assistance and representation**\*\*\* (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F24"">Figure 24</a>).

- Out of the people who experienced a non-trivial legal problem and whose problem's resolution process has concluded, in 25 Member States (all except for Czechia), six out of every ten respondents' **legal problems have been solved** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F29"">Figure 29</a>).
- In a majority of EU Member States, out of respondents who experienced a non-trivial legal problem and reported that the problem’s resolution process has concluded, over two-thirds said that the **resolution process concluded in less than a year** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F26"">Figure 26</a>) and that they were **able to afford the costs to solve their problem, or did not incur any costs at all** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F27"">Figure 27</a>).

152,findings,"Outlined below are the findings for this section. First, we present the main findings for the chapter, emphasizing notable insights in the data. This is followed by summaries of individual indicators organized by topic.

- While experts in most EU countries say their justice systems conduct effective and impartial criminal investigations, these positive perceptions are not shared among respondents in Cyprus, Bulgaria, and Greece. 
- Confidence in police conduct is high among respondents in most of the EU. In 26 Member States (Slovakia is the exception), most people say police respect the basic rights of suspects, and in 20 Member States, most people say the police do not use excessive or unnecessary force. 
However, the majority of respondents in 10 Member States doubt that authorities respect the presumption of innocence, and in 12 EU Member States, most people do not believe everyone has access to a fair trial.  Perceptions on both of these issues are especially low among Slovakian respondents.
- Across the EU, most respondents say that people living in poverty continue to face challenges related to public legal defense—in 14 Member States, fewer than half agree there is adequate public defense.",151,

154,html,"- The average score for the expert indicator of **effective and impartial criminal investigation** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.60 (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F30"">Figure 30</a>). Country-level scores range from 0.75 in Finland to 0.41 in Cyprus.
- In 26 Member States, the majority of respondents express having a lot or some **trust in the police**. Fewer than half of respondents in all 27 Member States believe that most or all **police officers are involved in corrupt practices** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F31"">Figure 31</a>). 
- Findings on public attitudes toward law enforcement indicate that levels of trust in the police tend to be inversely correlated with perceptions of corruption. For instance, in Finland, 91% of respondents have a lot or some trust in the police, while only 5.8% believe that most or all police officers engage in corrupt activities (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F31"">Figure 31</a>). In contrast, Cypriots report lower levels of trust in the police (33.8%) and higher perceptions of corruption (33.3%).
- In 26 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **the police perform serious and law-abiding investigations to find the perpetrators of a crime** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F32"">Figure 32</a>). However, in only eight Member States do the majority of respondents agree that **the police investigate crimes in an independent manner, without any sort of pressure** (<a class=""crossref"" href=""#R2F33"">Figure 33</a>).",153,

290,methodological,"The production of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* can be summarized in the following stages:

### Conceptual Design

To develop a comprehensive methodological framework, WJP first defined the observable outcomes of a society's adherence to the rule of law and the ways the rule of law impacts people's everyday lives. Building upon the proven methodology of the *World Justice Project Rule of Law Index®*, the team focused the conceptual design of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* on capturing people's perceptions and experiences of justice, governance, and the rule of law in their daily lives. 

The team then conducted an extensive literature review and held consultations with experts from various sectors (including academia and international organizations) to adapt the project's methodology to the current reality and challenges faced by the European Union (EU) Member States. The resulting framework defines 51 rule of law indicators organized into ten pillars: 1) checks on government powers; 2) government respect for checks on power; 3) civic participation; 4) fundamental rights; 5) civil justice; 6) criminal justice; 7) safety; 8) control of corruption; 9) transparency and access to information; and 10) administrative proceedings and regulatory enforcement.

After establishing these pillars and indicators, WJP drafted survey questions to measure different aspects of each conceptual category included in the framework. This process resulted in a selection of 610 expert survey questions and 330 general population survey questions. To maintain reasonable survey length and improve response rates, the expert questions were organized into four separate questionnaires (one on criminal justice, two on civil and commercial justice, and one on governance).

### Data collection

*World Justice Project EUROVOICES* presents original survey data from two sources: expert surveys and household surveys.

#### Expert Surveys

Expert survey data collection for the *EUROVOICES* project was conducted by the WJP’s research team. The surveys were administered online between October 2023 and April 2024 using Alchemer, a user-friendly and highly secure survey administration platform. The expert surveys were administered in twelve languages: Bulgarian, Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish.

The expert survey respondents, representing the 110 subnational regions across all 27 EU Member States, included independent legal practitioners and academics selected from directories of law firms, universities and colleges, research organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as through referrals from the WJP's global network of practitioners. All expert respondents were vetted by WJP staff to ensure their qualifications.

Over the course of the expert survey data collection, WJP's research team regularly sent survey invitations and reminder emails to potential respondents using publicly available online contact information, collected through a systematic review of the websites of law firms, bar associations, universities, and other organizations. To expand WJP's network of expert respondents in the EU, the research team collaborated with local organizations, bar associations, universities, and law firms to identify and invite potential participants. As a result of this exercise, WJP's team generated a database with contact information for thousands of experts. In total, the WJP team obtained 8,042 expert survey responses.

#### Household Surveys

Household survey data collection was conducted by leading local polling companies: ACT (Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), Alpha Research Ltd. (Bulgaria), Bilendi & Respondi (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands), D3 Systems, Inc. (Greece), ILRES (Luxembourg), Intercampus (Portugal), Ipsos (Czechia, Estonia, Finland, France, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden), Misco International (Malta), Pulse Market Research (Cyprus), RED C Research (Ireland), and Talk Online (Hungary and Slovakia).

The survey was translated into over 20 local languages, adapted to common local expressions, and administered in pilot tests in each country.  After conducting, reviewing, and validating the pilot tests, the survey was administered to respondents in 110 regions of the 27 EU Member States, using both face-to-face (in 10 countries) and online (in 17 countries) polling methodologies. Survey respondents in each country were selected through a probability sampling method that ensures representativeness based on age, sex, income level, and degree of urbanization. During the full-fieldwork stage of data collection, which took place between December 2023 and April 2024, a total of 64,089 EU residents were surveyed.

#### Selecting Territorial Units

For the purposes of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES*, WJP selected territorial units based on the EU’s Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system, resulting in 110 regions for analysis. These regions are a combination of NUTS level 1 and NUTS level 2 regions, with some adjustments for Czechia (merging 8 regions into 4), Finland (combining 5 regions into 4), and France (dropping the overseas territories). The complete list of regions is presented in the Appendix.

### Data Analysis

The expert survey data was calculated into scores using the following steps: first, the survey responses were normalized and codified into numeric values on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the highest possible score; second, the data was mapped into the pillars and indicators, as defined in the conceptual framework; and third, the normalized data was aggregated at the NUTS and country levels using simple averages. The complete variable map detailing which questions from the expert surveys were aggregated into each score can be downloaded from the website.

Household survey responses were processed into a database that displays question-level results by collapsing the two most positive options on a four-level Likert scale in each case (e.g., strongly agree and agree, very likely and likely, among others, depending on the response scale of the question and the options that represent the most positive outcome). This data can be disaggregated by age group, sex, income, and degree of urbanization.

For both the household and the expert surveys, the respondent-level data was edited to exclude partially completed surveys, suspicious data, and outliers (which were detected using the Z-score method).

A series of quantitative and qualitative tests were conducted to identify biases and errors. The first process was a quantitative cross-check in which results were systematically compared to selected indicators from trusted third-party sources, including other organizations' measurement projects, such as the V-Dem Dataset by the V-Dem Institute, and the Quality of Government database by the University of Gothenburg; and official indicator systems, such as Eurobarometer surveys and the EU Justice Scoreboard. 
In addition, three qualitative information tools were developed to test the data across all EU Member States: a compendium of news stories collected from diverse sources across the EU; syntheses of information from national and international reports published by peer organizations; and semi-structured interviews with over 30 EU experts. These tools allowed WJP to enrich the survey data with trends, issues, improvements, and regional differences in a variety of rule of law topics and contextualize the survey results.
As a result of this work, *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* presents a library of people-centered indicators with new data on justice, governance, and the rule of law in the EU, at both the regional and national level. Data from the expert surveys is presented at the indicator level, while household survey data is presented at the question level, with options to disaggregate by different socioeconomic and demographic variables. This data is presented in different formats, including thematic reports with maps and graphs, interactive dashboards, and databases available for download. This information allows region-to-region comparisons, detecting relative strengths and weaknesses, and identifying best practices and policies that can become reference points.

### Additional Considerations

#### Comparisons with the *WJP Rule of Law Index*

The results of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* cannot be directly compared to the *WJP Rule of Law Index®* for several reasons. First, the Index scores are calculated by aggregating three sources of information: expert surveys, household surveys, and third-party data. In contrast, *WJP EUROVOICES* presents findings in two separate categories: the Expert Scorecards, comprised of aggregated expert data, and People’s Voices, which displays question-level data from the household surveys.

Second, although the *WJP Rule of Law Index* and *WJP EUROVOICES* both use the Min-Max method to normalize expert data (so that all values are presented on a scale of 0 to 1), the Index’s longitudinal analysis requires an extra normalization (with a base year of 2015) to ensure scores are comparable across previous editions of the report.

Lastly, while *WJP EUROVOICES* builds upon the Index's methodology, the two projects have distinct conceptual frameworks. Key differences include the internal organization of the pillars, the inclusion of new questions to assess independent checks on government powers, a new category on the executive's behavior towards constraints on its power, the expansion of the chapter on fundamental rights based on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the separation of the transparency and civic participation pillars.

#### Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses

All information tools have advantages and limitations that need to be considered when using them, and *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* is no exception. This project organizes its findings into clearly defined indicators that allow for the easy and efficient interpretation of a multi-dimensional rule of law definition. Moreover, WJP's output-oriented approach facilitates comparisons between countries and regions.

However, this accessibility does require WJP to consolidate the unique and complicated realities different individuals experience into coherent findings at the national and regional levels. As such, interpretation of the data presented in this report requires a familiarity with the project's basic conceptual framework, including WJP's definitions for each indicator and explanations regarding which topics are and are not included in our findings.

Likewise, these indicators do not establish causality or contextualize the findings. Thus, it will be necessary to use the *WJP EUROVOICES* reports in combination with other analytical tools to provide a full picture of causes and potential solutions.

The data presented in *WJP EUROVOICES* captures the perceptions and experiences of people living in the EU at the time the data was collected. In addition, the WJP team confirmed the validity of this data using quantitative and qualitative checks. However, the results may be sensitive to contextual factors, including expectations, as well as cultural and social influences, which may affect people's responses. In addition, this information may be sensitive to specific events that took place during the data collection period or may be subject to measurement errors due in part to the limited number of experts interviewed in some regions.
