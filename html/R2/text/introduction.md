# Introduction

The rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the European Union (EU) is founded and represents a constitutional priority shared by all Member States (Article 2 of the Treaty on EU). The rule of law is essential for the proper functioning of democratic societies and the protection of human rights. Furthermore, the rule of law plays a pivotal role in shaping the potential for sustainable regional growth and development.

Adherence to this principle requires effective democratic institutions that ensure public accountability and the separation of powers. It also mandates access to independent and impartial courts that protect people's fundamental rights and guarantee equality before the law. Upholding the rule of law further requires implementing targeted, evidence-informed strategies at both national and subnational levels, which are tailored to meet the diverse needs of people across different regions.

In this context, *World Justice Project EUROVOICES* provides new data that captures the perceptions and experiences of people living in 110 subnational regions across the 27 EU Member States in the areas of justice, democratic governance, and the rule of law. The report series draws upon surveys responses from more than 8,000 local and independent legal experts, as well as regionally representative household surveys administered to more than 64,000 respondents across the EU. With this data, the World Justice Project (WJP) seeks to contribute to evidence-based decision-making at all government levels by helping decision-makers identify strengths, weaknesses, and policy priorities in their regions.  

This data is organized into three **thematic reports**: 

1. Democracy and Fundamental Rights
2. Justice and Safety
3. Transparency and Corruption
  
Each report focuses on a selection of pillars of the rule of law, comprised of indicators that cover specific dimensions of each concept. Findings for each indicator are categorized into **Expert Scorecards**, calculated using expert survey responses, and **People’s Voices**, highlighting complementary question-level data from WJP’s household surveys. These two categories are presented side-by-side, offering a comprehensive view of how EU residents perceive and experience justice, governance, and the rule of law in their respective regions.  

The Expert Scorecard captures legal experts’ assessments of composite indicators with scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest possible score and 0 is the lowest possible score. Each score is calculated by aggregating a set of questions that are relevant to various dimensions of the concept being measured. This expert data allows for a deeper examination of the technical aspects that determine how people interact with a complex network of institutions and the justice system. In contrast, findings from the People’s Voices database, presented at the question level using percentages (0 to 100%), reflect the beliefs and experiences of the general population.  
  
The project’s conceptual framework builds upon the tested and proven methodology of the *WJP Rule of Law Index®*—a rigorous quantitative tool that evaluates and ranks 142 countries across key dimensions of the rule of law—with adaptations to reflect the institutional architecture in the EU. It should be noted that the results of both tools are not comparable, because this project presents data from its household surveys separately from its Expert Scorecards, whereas the Index integrates the General Population Poll into each country’s aggregate scores. Additionally, adjustments have been made to the conceptual framework and to the data analysis protocol, including changes in the methods used to calculate scores. For more information on the methodology of *World Justice Project EUROVOICES*, refer to the methodology section at the end of this report.

Given the diversity of institutional design across EU Member States, the questions in this project’s surveys mainly focus on the outcomes experienced by individuals concerning different issues related to justice, governance, and the rule of law. These outcomes result from their interactions with a complex network of institutions at local, national, and supranational levels. In this sense, the questionnaires minimized references to government institutions, focusing instead on the perceptions and experiences of people in the city, town, or village where they live. Regional information was produced following the framework of territorial divisions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system.

This project is funded by the EU and complements other research activities conducted by the WJP with the mission of advancing the rule of law worldwide. This data may also complement other monitoring tools that aim to promote a rule of law culture and enhance economic, social, and territorial cohesion in the EU, such as the European Commission’s yearly Rule of Law Report, the EU Justice Scoreboard, and the Cohesion Report, among others.

### Key Findings

Democracy and Fundamental Rights:

- Most people across the EU believe that judges lack independence, and expert assessments on judicial independence reveal stark disparities between countries. 
- While the freedoms of assembly, association, and expression are well-protected across most of the EU, some regions are falling short in upholding these essential rights.
- Most people in the EU believe senior government officials use misinformation to shape public opinion in their favor. 
- Discrimination remains a pervasive challenge across the EU. At least one in five people faced discrimination during the past year in 22 EU countries.
- Most people in the EU agree that they can vote freely, without feeling harassed or pressured.

Justice and Safety

- Across the EU, most people believe that civil and commercial courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner.
- Across the EU, respondents think that most people cannot easily meet the costs of state dispute resolution mechanisms if they faced a legal problem. Furthermore, most respondents believe people in their country do not have access to affordable legal assistance and representation when they face a legal problem.
- Legal problems are ubiquitous across the EU, and most people who needed a dispute resolution mechanism in the last two years did not have access to one. This finding presents a major challenge to many EU countries aiming to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target on access to justice for all (SDG 16.3.3).
- In most EU regions, people believe that the criminal justice system does not work the same for everyone, regardless of where they live.

Transparency and Corruption

- Among different state institutions, people in the EU perceive political parties as the most corrupt.
- Across the EU, most respondents believe government actions to control corruption are ineffective.
- Most people across the EU believe that local authorities provide accessible information.
- Although legal experts say business regulations in the EU are predictable and evenly enforced, they agree that navigating the startup process remains unnecessarily cumbersome.

General Trends Across Regions

- Across the EU, where democratic governance is stronger,so is economic development.
- Reported levels of public trust are markedly higher for local authorities than for national governments. Across the EU, 52% of respondents reported having a lot or some trust in their local governments, compared to 41% who expressed the same level of trust in their national governments.
- Regional perceptions within countries tend to align closely with each other across most rule of law dimensions, showing less variation compared to differences seen between countries.
- Across the EU, urban and rural residents have similar views on the state of justice and the rule of law, although some differences appear across specific regions, countries, population groups, and topics.
- Across the EU, women tend to share similar views to men on the performance of government institutions, though they have more negative views regarding gender equality in public and private life.

### About this Report

EUROVOICES presents two different types of indicators: Expert Scorecard and People’s Voices. The Expert Scorecard provides an aggregated score at either the subnational or national level, depending on the topic, based on data from WJP’s survey of local and independent legal experts and practitioners from different disciplines. Explore the variable map, found in the “downloads” section, with information on the individual expert survey questions that make up each aggregated score. People’s Voices presents selected question-level data from household surveys to representative samples across the EU on each topic. Additional data and sociodemographic breakdowns of the People’s Voices indicators can be explored on the EUROVOICES dashboard. 

This report, Justice and Safety, consists of three chapters: (I) **Civil Justice**, (II) **Criminal Justice**, and (III) **Safety**. Each chapter contains thematic findings, definitions for each indicator included, as well as graphs with data from both the expert and household surveys (Expert Scorecard and People’s Voices, respectively).

When the rule of law prevails, both governing authorities and the people they serve respect the rights of others, contributing to a secure and just society. Additionally, people should have access to effective legal mechanisms to resolve their legal issues or seek redress for violations of their rights.
In conceptualizing safety and access to justice, WJP uses a people-centered approach, focusing on individuals’ justice journeys. This approach seeks to analytically reconstruct people’s experiences as they navigate different justice services in their quest to resolve their legal disputes. 

1. **_Civil Justice_**: The first chapter of this report focuses on civil justice, defined as the array of services and mechanisms people use to resolve non-criminal disputes, including family, labor, commercial, environmental, administrative, and financial disputes, as well as consumer issues. 

    Indicators for civil justice include (1) legal capability, (2) access to legal aid and representation in case of civil disputes, (3) accessible, appropriate, and timely dispute resolution, (4) impartial and independent dispute resolution, (5) outcome-oriented and effective dispute resolution, and (6) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. 

    To further explore these issues, the chapter concludes with new, region-specific findings from the *WJP Global Legal Needs Survey* (a special module included in the household surveys), which provides in-depth insights into the prevalence of civil and administrative legal problems and the efficacy of the justice system for resolving those problems, as experienced by individuals seeking justice.


2. **_Criminal Justice_**: Strong rule of law systems depend on the ability of impartial and independent criminal justice mechanisms to redress grievances and bring action against individuals for offenses against society. Effective criminal justice mechanisms ensure that victims of criminal acts have access to competent, prompt, and effective mechanisms for criminal investigation, prosecution, and adjudication. Moreover, these justice services must be accessible to all members of society, regardless of where they live or their personal characteristics. 

    Additionally, the criminal justice system must follow due process and uphold the rights of all involved parties, including victims, individuals accused of a crime, and persons deprived of their liberty. This chapter includes indicators on (1) effective and impartial criminal investigation, (2) effective and impartial prosecution and pre-trial proceedings, (3) effective and impartial criminal adjudication, (4) alternative criminal justice mechanisms, (5) victims’ rights, (6) due process of law, and (7) right of persons deprived of liberty.

3. **_Safety_**: Security is one of the defining aspects of any rule of law society and is a fundamental function of the state. It is also a precondition for the realization of the rights and freedoms that the rule of law seeks to advance. Thus, effective crime control and the reduction of violence are key components of the rule of law. 

    This chapter examines how well governments meet these safety objectives by focusing on two indicators from the general population poll: (1) perceptions of safety and (2) control of violence.
