# Introduction

The rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the European Union (EU) is
founded and represents a constitutional priority shared by all Member States (Article 2 of the
Treaty on EU). The rule of law is essential for the well-functioning of democratic societies and
the protection of human rights. Furthermore, the rule of law plays a pivotal role in shaping
the potential for sustainable regional growth and development.
Adherence to this principle requires the proper functioning of democratic institutions that
ensure public accountability and the separation of powers. It also mandates access to
independent and impartial courts that protect people's fundamental rights and guarantee
equality before the law. Upholding the rule of law further requires implementing targeted,
evidence-informed strategies at both national and subnational levels, which are tailored to
the needs of people across different regions, thus leaving no one behind.
In this context, World Justice Project EUROVOICES provides new data that captures the
perceptions and experiences of people living in 110 subnational regions across the 27 EU
Member States in the areas of justice, democratic governance, and the rule of law. It is based
on surveys to more than 8,000 local and independent legal experts, as well as household
surveys to more than 64,000 respondents. With this data, the World Justice Project (WJP)
seeks to contribute to evidence-based decision-making at all government levels and help
decision-makers identify strengths, weaknesses, and policy priorities in their regions.

This data is organized into three **thematic reports**:
(1) Democracy & Fundamental Rights
(2) Justice & Safety
(3) Transparency & Corruption 

Each report contains indicators calculated using the responses of the expert surveys (Expert
Scorecard) and complemented with question-level data from WJP’s household surveys
(People’s Voices). The findings from these surveys are presented side-by-side, offering a
comprehensive view of how EU residents perceive and experience justice, governance, and
the rule of law in their respective regions.
The Expert Scorecard captures legal experts’ assessments of composite indicators with
scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest possible score and 0 is the lowest possible
score. Each score is calculated by aggregating a set of questions that touch on various
dimensions of the concept being measured. Through expert surveys, it is possible to probe
more deeply into technical aspects of how people interact with a complex network of
institutions and the justice system. In contrast, the data from the People’s Voices database, 
presented at the question-level using percentages (0 to 100%), reflect the beliefs and
experiences of the general population.

The project’s conceptual framework was designed building upon the tested and proven
methodology of the WJP Rule of Law Index®—a rigorous quantitative tool that evaluates and
ranks 142 countries across key dimensions of the rule of law— with adaptations to reflect
the institutional architecture in the EU. It should be noted that the results of both tools are
not comparable, because this project presents data from the general population poll
separately, whereas the Index integrates it into the aggregate scores. In addition,
adjustments have been made to the conceptual framework and to the analysis of the data,
including changes in the methods used to calculate scores. For more information on the
methodology of World Justice Project EUROVOICES, refer to the methodology section at the
end of this report.
Given the diversity of institutional designs across EU Member States, the questions in this
project’s surveys mainly focus on the outcomes experienced by individuals concerning
different issues related to justice, governance, and rule of law. These outcomes result from
their interactions with a complex network of institutions at local, national, and supranational
levels. In this sense, the questionnaires minimized references to government institutions,
focusing instead on the perceptions and experiences of people in the city, town, or village
where they live. Regional information was produced following the framework of territorial
divisions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system.
This project is funded by the EU and complements other research activities conducted by
the WJP with the mission of advancing the rule of law worldwide. This data may also
complement other monitoring tools that aim to promote a rule of law culture and enhance
economic, social, and territorial cohesion in the EU, such as the European Commission’s
yearly Rule of Law Report, and the EU Justice Scoreboard, and the Cohesion Report, among
others. 

This report (“Justice & Safety”) includes three chapters: (1) **Civil justice**, (2) **Criminal justice**,
and (3) **Safety**. Each chapter contains thematic findings, definitions for each indicator
included, as well as graphs with data from both the expert and household surveys (Expert
Scorecard and People’s Voices, respectively).

1. **Civil justice**: When the rule of law prevails, both people and authorities respect the
rights of others, contributing to a safe environment. In addition, people should have
access to effective legal mechanisms to resolve their legal issues or seek redress for
violations of their rights.

In conceptualizing safety and access to justice, WJP uses a people-centered
approach, focusing on individuals’ justice journeys. This approach seeks to
analytically reconstruct people’s experiences as they navigate through different
justice services in their quest to resolve their legal disputes.
The first chapter of this report focuses on civil justice, defined as the array of
mechanisms people use to resolve non-criminal disputes, including family, labor,
commercial, environmental, administrative, and financial disputes, and consumer
issues. Indicators for civil justice include (1) legal capability, (2) access to legal aid
and representation in case of civil disputes, (3) accessible, appropriate, and timely
dispute resolution, (4) impartial and independent dispute resolution, (5) outcomeoriented and effective dispute resolution, and (6) alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms.

Additionally, this chapter details findings from a special module included in the
general population survey, providing in-depth insights into the prevalence of legal
problems and the efficacy of the justice system as experienced by those who faced
legal problems. This information is presented in a special module at the end of the
chapter. 

2. **Criminal justice**: A key dimension of the rule of law is the ability for all people to seek
redress in impartial and independent courts to uphold their rights. This encompasses
ensuring that victims of criminal acts have access to competent, prompt, and
effective mechanisms for criminal investigation, prosecution, and adjudication. In
addition, these justice services must be provided consistently to everyone,
regardless of where they live or their personal characteristics.
It is also important to verify that the rights of all parties involved in the criminal justice
system are upheld, including the rights of victims, adherence to due process for the
accused of a crime, and respect for the rights of persons deprived of their liberty.
This chapter includes indicators on (1) effective and impartial criminal investigation,
(2) effective and impartial prosecution and pre-trial proceedings, (3) effective and
impartial criminal adjudication, (4) alternative criminal justice mechanisms, (5)
victims’ rights, (6) due process of law, and (7) right of persons deprived of liberty.

3. **Safety**: Adherence to the rule of law is essential for ensuring that people are
protected from situations that may violate their rights, namely from criminal threats.
This not only safeguards their physical integrity but also their property rights. Thus,
effective crime control and the reduction of violence are key components of the rule
of law. This pillar examines how well these objectives are met by focusing on two
indicators from the general population poll: (1) perceptions of safety and (2) control
of violence.
