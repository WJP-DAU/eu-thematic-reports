# We asked 72,000 people in the EU if they feel safe and if justice is met. Most people believe...

## courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner,

## people cannot afford legal assistance,

## justice does not function equally for everyone.

##### **Most people who experienced legal problems got the advice they needed**: Legal problems are ubiquitous across the EU. People facing legal problems have access to quality information and advice, and, to a lesser extent, appropriate assistance and representation. However, it can be difficult to access dispute resolution mechanisms when needed. 

##### **In general, people believe that justice is expensive**: Across the EU, respondents think that most people cannot easily afford the costs of legal assistance and representation, or the costs of dispute resolution mechanisms if they face a legal problem.

##### **Civil justice is not timely**: Across the EU, most people believe that civil and commercial courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner. 

##### **Criminal justice is effective overall, but not all people benefit equally**: Most people in the EU agree that the criminal justice system is effective and respects the rights of both victims and the accused; however, they donâ€™t believe all people are treated equally.
