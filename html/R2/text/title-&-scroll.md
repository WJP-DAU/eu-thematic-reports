# We asked 72,000 people in the EU if they feel safe and if justice is met. Most people believe...

## courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner,

## people cannot afford legal assistance,

## justice does not function equally for everyone.

##### Across the EU, most people believe that civil and commercial courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner. 

##### Across the EU, respondents think that most people cannot easily meet the costs of state dispute resolution mechanisms if they faced a legal problem. Furthermore, most respondents believe people in their country do not have access to affordable legal assistance and representation when they face a legal problem. 

##### Legal problems are ubiquitous across the EU, and most people who needed a dispute resolution mechanism in the last two years did not have access to one. This finding presents a major challenge to many EU countries aiming to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target on access to justice for all (SDG 16.3.3).

##### In most EU regions, people believe that the criminal justice system does not work the same for everyone, regardless of where they live.
