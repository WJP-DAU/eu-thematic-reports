# Thematic Findings

## Control of corruption

- Across the EU, local legal experts say high-level corruption—including corrupt public procurement practices and political graft—is a more prevalent issue than street-level corruption.
- People in the EU believe political parties and members of the legislature are more corrupt than the police and local and national government officials. However, there is considerable variation in the level of concern between respondents of different EU Member States. In Sweden, only 5% of people think that police officers are corrupt, while at least 30% think so in Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.
- The majority of people in all EU Member States believe government actions to control corruption are ineffective and applied selectively.

### 1. Absence of bribery

This indicator explores the absence of bribery in administrative procedures and interactions with the police and court personnel. It assesses whether individuals who interact with the police and court staff have to make informal payments or gifts to receive a public service or expedite a process.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **absence of bribery** across the 27 EU Member States is 0.74 (Figure 1). Country-level scores range from 0.98 in Denmark to 0.46 in Bulgaria (graded on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies the best possible score).
- In all 27 Member States, the majority of respondents from the general population believe that their **national government's efforts to combat corruption are ineffective** (Figure 17) and that **measures against corruption are not applied impartially** (Figure 18).
- In 5 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that they are **personally affected by corruption in their daily lives**. At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree they are personally affected by corruption ranges from just 10.9% in Denmark to 68.6% in Cyprus (Figure 15).
- Compared to a selection of government institutions, perceptions of corruption are highest regarding political parties: in 17 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all **political parties** are involved in corrupt practices (Figure 11). Meanwhile, in 9 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that most or all **Members of Parliament/Congress** are corrupt (Figure 2), and in 6 Member States, the majority believe most or all **officials in the national government are corrupt** (Figure 3). In contrast, respondents across the EU report that perceptions of corruption are the lowest regarding **car registration officers** (Figure 10), **land registry officers** (Figure 9), and **police officers** (Figure 8).

### 2. Absence of corrupt procurement practices

This indicator evaluates the prevalence of grand corruption, specifically in public procurement (graft) and political processes. This includes instances where high-ranking officials use their influence to award government contracts without competitive bidding or purchase goods at inflated prices. Additionally, this indicator examines whether high-ranking officials solicit or receive informal payments in exchange for political favors, including favorable treatment, favorable votes, and access to policymakers.

- The average score among the 27 EU Member States for the expert indicator that evaluates the extent of practices of grand corruption, including graft in public procurement and the political process, is 0.54 (Figure 19). Country-level scores range from 0.89 in Finland to 0.25 in Bulgaria.
- In 21 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **the only way to succeed in business is to have political connections**. At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree ranges from 19.5% in Sweden to 75.5% in Croatia (Figure 20).

### 3. Absence of embezzlement

This indicator measures the prevalence of theft or misappropriation of public funds or other state resources for personal use by public sector employees or elected officials.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **absence of embezzlement** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.60 (Figure 21). Country-level scores range from 0.90 in Finland to 0.32 in Bulgaria.

### 4. Absence of favoritism

This indicator refers to the practice of using positions of public authority to benefit friends or family members, without necessarily requiring the exchange of political favors for money or gifts.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **absence of favoritism** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.53 (Figure 22). Country-level scores range from 0.84 in Finland and Sweden to 0.27 in Bulgaria.

### 5. Absence of corrupt electoral practices

This indicator examines the prevalence of the misuse of public funds to benefit a political campaign or to interfere with the electoral process. It includes vote buying and cases where election officials request or receive bribes to benefit a candidate.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **absence of corrupt electoral practices** across the 27 EU Member States is 0.57 (Figure 23). Country-level scores range from 0.90 in Finland to 0.24 in Bulgaria.
- In all 27 Member States, the vast majority of people think **it is unacceptable for an elected official to take public funds for private use**. At the country-level, the percentage of respondents who say corrupt practices among elected officials are unacceptable range from 97.0% in Finland to 79.1% in Romania (Figure 24). 
- Most people across the EU believe **it is unacceptable for a public officer to be recruited on the basis of family ties and friendship networks**. Figures range from 85.6% in Italy to 49.9% in Luxembourg (Figure 25).

## Transparency and Access to Information

- Perceptions of transparency vary considerably across the EU, with experts in Sweden reporting the highest levels of positivity and experts in Romania reporting the lowest.
- People lack confidence in their ability to access detailed public information from government agencies in a majority of EU countries.

### 1. Transparency and access to information

This indicator includes information on public institutions’ transparency measures and the accessibility of different types of public information. Additionally, it covers the publicity of laws and whether the right to request information is effectively guaranteed.

- The average score for the expert indicator to the right of **transparency and access to information** across the 27 EU Member States is 0.67 (Figure 26). Country-level scores range from 0.83 in Sweden to 0.52 in Romania.
- In 14 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **local authorities provide people with information about their rights** (Figure 27), and in 9 EU countries, the majority of respondents believe that **local authorities provide information in a simple, easy-to-read way** (Figure 28).
- In 21 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that local authorities make **information easy to find online** (Figure 29), yet only in Poland do the majority of people agree that this **information is easy to find without using the internet** (i.e., by using leaflets or posters) (Figure 30).
- In 26 Member States (data was not collected in Ireland for these questions), fewer than half of respondents believe it is likely or very likely that **government agencies would grant information requests related to copies of government contracts or to detailed budget figures of government agencies** (Figure 31). In most Member States, people tend to agree it is more likely to be granted information on budget figures than government contracts.

## Administrative proceedings, regulatory enforcement, and right to property

- While legal experts in the EU believe business regulation is predictable and evenly enforced, they say that starting and operating a business in the EU is unnecessarily complicated.

### 1. Simple, predictable, and timely administrative proceedings

This indicator captures public experiences and perceptions regarding the efficiency and integrity of administrative proceedings. It evaluates the clarity, accessibility, and predictability of the legal framework for businesses, as well as the simplicity and timeliness of administrative proceedings.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **simple, predictable, and timely administrative proceedings** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.61 (Figure 32). Country-level scores range from 0.86 in Finland to 0.43 in Romania.

### 2. Right to property

This indicator evaluates whether all people have the right to acquire, own, and dispose of property to the extent permitted by law. It also examines whether expropriation and other proceedings with similar results are conducted legally and solely for public benefit.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **right to property** across the 27 EU Member States is 0.66 (Figure 33). Country-level scores range from 0.84 in Denmark to 0.53 in Bulgaria.

### 3. Regulatory enforcement

This indicator assesses the regularity and effectiveness of audits and inspections to ensure they are conducted lawfully and without corruption. It also evaluates the accessibility and simplicity of complaint mechanisms, the impartiality and effectiveness of regulatory investigations, and the appropriateness of sanctions for violations.

- The average score for the expert indicator which assesses regulatory enforcement, or the regularity and effectiveness of audits and inspections, among the 27 EU Member States is 0.66 (Figure 34). Country-level scores range from 0.79 in Austria to 0.46 in Malta.
