# Thematic Findings

## 5. Civil Justice
- Justice is too expensive. Malta is the only country where most people believe dispute
resolution mechanisms are affordable.
- Backlogs and delays are widespread in civil and commercial courts.
- People are not aware of their legal rights. Romania, Poland, and Greece are the only
EU countries where most people feel aware of their rights when facing a legal
problem.
- In 15 Member States*, most respondents experienced at least one non-trivial legal
problem** over the previous two years. The prevalence of legal problems varies
widely across the EU, as figures range from just 15.6% in Portugal to 71.0% in
Hungary. The most common legal problems were related to consumer protection.
- Most EU residents who had a non-trivial legal issue did not have access to
appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms. This represents a major challenge for
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals target 16.3.3 of access to justice for
all.
*The module on legal needs covers 26 out of the 27 EU member states; this data was not
collected in Ireland.
**We understand non-trivial legal problems as those that respondents label with a
seriousness larger than or equal to 4 on a scale of 0 to 10.

### 5.1 Legal capability
This indicator refers to an individual's ability to navigate the legal system and, by doing so,
uphold their rights and readily access justice. This sub-pillar measures people's awareness
of their rights and knowledge of where to obtain legal information and advice. 

- The average score for the expert indicator of **legal capability** among the 27 EU
Member States is 0.57 (Figure 5.1). Scores range from 0.70 in Finland to 0.47 in
Greece. 
-  Only in 3 Member States (Romania, Poland and Greece), the majority of respondents
from the general population agree that **people are aware of their legal rights** (Figure
5.5.1).
- In 6 Member States, the majority agree that **people know where to get legal
information and advice when they face a legal problem** (Figure 5.1.2). 

### 5.2. Access to legal aid and representation in case of civil disputes
This indicator explores the accessibility and quality of legal aid services in civil disputes, as

that these services are available to all regardless of their socioeconomic status, responsive
to different types of problems, and not subject to unreasonable delays.

meet the costs of state dispute resolution mechanisms** (courts, small claims
courts, administrative agencies, etc.) when they face a legal problem (Figure 5.3.1). 

### 5.4. Impartial and independent dispute resolution
This indicator assesses the procedural fairness of dispute resolution in civil justice, by
evaluating the characteristics that underpin the trustworthiness of the justice system,
including the absence of discrimination, bias in judicial decisions, corruption, and undue
political influence in the delivery of justice. 

- The average score for the expert indicator of **impartial and independent dispute
resolution** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.70 (Figure 5.4). Scores range from
0.87 in Finland and Estonia to 0.51 in Croatia.
- In only 1 Member State (Denmark), the majority of respondents agree that **state
dispute resolution mechanisms (courts, small claims courts, administrative
agencies, etc.) produce fair outcomes for each involved party** (Figure 5.4.1). In 4
Member States (Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, and Luxembourg), the majority
of respondents agree that **all parties are treated equally and fairly within the civil
justice system** (Figure 5.4.2).

### 5.5. Effective and outcome-oriented dispute resolution
This indicator portrays justice system users’ perceptions on the outcome of their processes,
including the extent to which civil justice processes are geared toward achieving meaningful
and satisfactory outcomes for all parties involved, and whether these are effectively
enforced.

- The average score for the expert indicator of **effective and outcome-oriented
dispute resolution** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.57, with scores ranging
from 0.73 in Finland to 0.45 in Italy (Figure 5.5).
- In all 27 Member States, fewer than half of respondents agree that **winning parties
can enforce court decisions quickly and effectively**, with figures ranging from
45.9% in Poland to 20.3% in Slovenia (Figure 5.5.1).

### 5.6. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms
This indicator explores non-formal or abridged approaches to resolving disputes outside
the formal judicial system, such as mediation, conciliation, or arbitration. This category
assesses their accessibility, fairness, and effectiveness for solving people’s legal problems.
- The average score for the expert indicator of **alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.58 (Figure 5.6). Scores range
from 0.73 in Finland to 0.53 in Croatia.
- In 6 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **people can easily turn
to alternative justice mechanisms** (mediation, arbitration, restorative justice, etc.)
when they face a legal problem (Figure 5.6.1). 

### Access to justice
- In 15 Member States, out of 26 surveyed countries*, over half of respondents
**experienced one or more non-trivial legal problems**** over the previous two
years, with prevalence ranging from 15.6% in Portugal to 71.0% in Hungary (Figure
5.7.1). The most **commonly reported legal problems** were related to consumer
protection, housing, and public services (Figure 5.7.2).
- Among persons with non-trivial** legal problems, in 26 Member States, the majority
had access to good information and advice (Figure 5.7.5) and, in 18 Member States,
the majority had **access to adequate assistance and representation***** (Figure
5.7.6). However, in only 3 Member States (Greece, Malta, and Bulgaria), the majority
of respondents, out of those who experienced a non-trivial legal problem**, had
**access to a dispute resolution mechanism** (Figure 5.7.7).
- Out of the people who experienced a non-trivial** legal problem and whose
problem's resolution process has concluded, in 25 Member States (all except for
Czechia), six out of every ten respondents' **legal problems have been solved**
(Figure 5.7.11).
- Out of the people who experienced a non-trivial** legal problem and whose
problem's resolution process has concluded, in 14 Member States, over two thirds
of respondents' **resolution process concluded in less than a year** (Figure 5.7.8);
and in 25 Member States, over two thirds were **able to afford the costs to solve
their problem, or did not incur any costs at all** (Figure 5.7.9). However, only in 5
Member States, the majority of respondents thought the **resolution process was
fair, regardless of the outcome** (Figure 5.7.10). 
*The module on legal needs covers 26 out of the 27 EU member states; this data was not
collected in Ireland. **We understand non-trivial legal problems as those that respondents
label with a severity larger than or equal to 4 on a scale of 0 to 10. ***Adequate assistance
and representation include those obtained from any of the following entities: a lawyer, a
professional advisor, an advice service, a government legal aid office, a court or
government body, the police, a health or welfare professional, a trade union or employer, a
civil society organization, or a charity.

## 6. Criminal Justice

States (Slovakia is the exception), most people say police respect the basic rights of
suspects. In 20 Member States, most people say the police do not use excessive or
unnecessary force.
- However, in 10 Member States, most people doubt the authorities respect the
presumption of innocence, and in 12 EU Member States, most people do not
believe everyone has access to a fair trial. . Confidence is especially low in Slovakia

in poverty, and in 14 Member States, fewer than half agree there is adequate public
defense.

category examines the impartiality and integrity of the adjudication process, guaranteeing
that decisions are impartial and free of corruption or undue influence.
