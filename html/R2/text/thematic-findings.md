# Thematic Findings

## Civil Justice

Outlined below are the findings for this section. First, we present the main findings for the chapter, emphasizing notable insights in the data. This is followed by summaries of individual indicators organized by topic.

- People perceive justice as being too expensive. Malta is the only EU Member State where most people agree they can easily meet the costs of turning to a state dispute resolution mechanism when they face a legal problem.
- Across the EU, most people perceive that civil and commercial courts do not resolve cases in a timely manner.
- People are not aware of their legal rights. Romania, Poland, and Greece are the only EU Member States in which the majority of respondents feel aware of their rights when facing a legal problem.
- In 15 Member States\*, a majority of respondents experienced at least one non-trivial legal problem\*\* in the past two years. The prevalence of legal problems varies widely across the EU, as just 15.6% of respondents experienced a recent legal problem in Portugal, while 71.0% did in Hungary. For respondents in all countries, the most common legal problems were related to consumer protection.
- Most EU residents who experienced a non-trivial legal issue** and needed access to a dispute resolution mechanism did not have access to it. This finding presents a major challenge to many EU countries aiming to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target on access to justice for all (SDG 16.3.3). 

\*The module on legal needs covers 26 out of the 27 EU Member States; this data was not collected in Ireland.
\*\*We understand non-trivial legal problems as those that respondents label with a seriousness larger than or equal to 4 on a scale of 0 to 10.

### Legal capability

- The average score for the expert indicator  of **legal capability** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.58 (Figure 1). Country-level scores range from 0.69 in Finland and Ireland to 0.47 in Greece and Poland.
- Most EU residents feel that people lack legal awareness. Romania, Poland, and Greece are the only EU Member States in which the majority of respondents agree that **people are aware of their legal rights** (Figure 2).   
- In just 6 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **people know where to get legal information and advice when they face a legal problem** (Figure 3).  

### Access to legal aid and representation in civil disputes

- The average score for the expert indicator of **access to legal aid and representation in civil cases** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.64 (Figure 4). Country-level scores range from 0.78 in Germany to 0.57 in Cyprus and Hungary. 
- In only 7 Member States, most respondents agree that **people have access to affordable legal assistance and representation when they face a legal problem** (Figure 5). 


### Accessible, appropriate, and timely dispute resolution

- The average score for the expert indicator of **accessible, appropriate, and timely dispute resolution** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.49 (Figure 6). Country-level scores range from 0.64 in Estonia to 0.38 in Poland. 
- Lengthy court proceedings are an issue throughout the EU. In all EU Member States, fewer than half of respondents agree that **civil and commercial courts adjudicate disputes quickly** (Figure 8). 
- In 26 Member States (except Malta), fewer than half of respondents agree that **people can easily meet the costs of state dispute resolution mechanisms** (courts, small claims courts, administrative agencies, etc.) when they face a legal problem (Figure 7). 


### Impartial and independent dispute resolution

- The average score for the expert indicator of **impartial and independent dispute resolution** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.70 (Figure 9). Country-level scores range from 0.89 in Denmark to 0.55 in Bulgaria.
- Only in Denmark  do the majority of respondents agree that **state dispute resolution mechanisms (courts, small claims courts, administrative agencies, etc.) produce fair outcomes for each involved party** (Figure 10). In just 4 Member States (Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, and Luxembourg), the majority of respondents agree that **all parties are treated equally and fairly within the civil justice system** (Figure 11).
- Denmark and Finland are the only two EU Member States in which the majority  of respondents agree that **local courts are free of corruption** (Figure 12). At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree with this statement ranges from 70.5% in Denmark to approximately   11% in Lithuania, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.  
- In 5 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **judges decide cases in an independent manner** (Figure 14), while Denmark and the Netherlands are the only Member States in which the majority of respondents agree that **local courts are free of political influence in their application of power** (Figure 13). 


### Effective and outcome-oriented dispute resolution

- The average score for the expert indicator of **effective and outcome-oriented dispute resolution** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.57 (Figure 15). Country-level scores range from 0.73 in Finland to 0.46 in Italy.
- In all 27 Member States, fewer than half of respondents agree that **winning parties can enforce court decisions quickly and effectively**. At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree with this statement ranges from 45.9% in Poland to 20.3% in Slovenia (Figure 16). 


### Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms

- The average score for the expert indicator of **alternative dispute resolution mechanisms** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.58 (Figure 17). Country-level scores range from 0.73 in Finland to 0.49 in Romania, Czechia, Bulgaria, and Slovakia. 
- In 6 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **people can easily turn to alternative justice mechanisms** (mediation, arbitration, restorative justice, etc.) when they face a legal problem (Figure 18). 


### WJP Global Legal Needs Survey module

- In 15 Member States\*, over half  of respondents experienced one or more **non-trivial legal problems\*\* in the past two years**, with prevalence at the country-level ranging from 15.6% in Portugal to 71.0% in Hungary (Figure 19). Across the EU, the most **commonly reported legal problems** were related to consumer protection, housing, and public services (Figure 20).    
- Among all  respondents who reported experiencing non-trivial legal problems, at least half  had **access to good information and advice** (Figure 23) and, in 18 Member States, the majority of respondents had **access to adequate assistance and representation**\*\*\* (Figure 24). However, Malta and Bulgaria were the only two Member States in which the majority of respondents, out of those who experienced a non-trivial legal problem and needed access, had **access to a dispute resolution mechanism** (Figure 25).       
- Out of the people who experienced a non-trivial legal problem and whose problem's resolution process has concluded, in 25 Member States (all except for Czechia), six out of every ten respondents' **legal problems have been solved** (Figure 29).
- In a majority of EU Member States, out of respondents who experienced a non-trivial legal problem and reported that the problem’s resolution process has concluded, over two-thirds said that the **resolution process concluded in less than a year** (Figure 26) and that they were **able to afford the costs to solve their problem, or did not incur any costs at all** (Figure 27).  However, this group of respondents did not think their experiences were fair—in only 5 Member States did the majority of respondents agree that the **resolution process was fair, regardless of the outcome** (Figure 28).

\*The module on legal needs covers 26 out of the 27 EU member states; this data was not collected in Ireland.
\*\*We understand non-trivial legal problems as those that respondents label with a severity larger than or equal to 4 on a scale of 0 to 10.
\*\*\*Adequate assistance and representation include those obtained from any of the following entities: a lawyer, a professional advisor, an advice service, a government legal aid office, a court or government body, the police, a health or welfare professional, a trade union or employer, a civil society organization, or a charity.


## Criminal Justice

Outlined below are the findings for this section. First, we present the main findings for the chapter, emphasizing notable insights in the data. This is followed by summaries of individual indicators organized by topic.

- While experts in most EU countries say their justice systems conduct effective and impartial criminal investigations, these positive perceptions are not shared among respondents in Cyprus, Bulgaria and Greece. 
- Confidence in police conduct is high among respondents in most of the EU. In 26 Member States (Slovakia is the exception), most people say police respect the basic rights of suspects, and in 20 Member States, most people say the police do not use excessive or unnecessary force. 
However, the majority of respondents in 10 Member States doubt that authorities respect the presumption of innocence, and in 12 EU Member States, most people do not believe everyone has access to a fair trial.  Perceptions on both of these issues are especially low among Slovakian respondents.
- Across the EU, most respondents say that people living in poverty continue to face challenges related to public legal defense—in 14 Member States, fewer than half agree there is adequate public defense. 


### Effective and impartial criminal investigation

- The average score for the expert indicator of **effective and impartial criminal investigation** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.60 (Figure 30). Country-level scores range from 0.75 in Finland to 0.41 in Cyprus.
- In 26 Member States, the majority of respondents express having a lot or some **trust in the police**. Fewer than half of respondents in all 27 Member States believe that most or all **police officers are involved in corrupt practices** (Figure 31). 
- Findings on public attitudes toward law enforcement indicate that levels of trust in the police tend to be inversely correlated with perceptions of corruption. For instance, in Finland, 91% of respondents have a lot or some trust in the police, while only 5.8% believe that most or all police officers engage in corrupt activities (Figure 31). In contrast, Cypriots report lower levels of trust in the police (33.8%) and higher perceptions of corruption (33.3%).
- In 26 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **the police perform serious and law-abiding investigations to find the perpetrators of a crime** (Figure 32). However, in only 8 Member States do the majority of respondents agree that **the police investigate crimes in an independent manner, without any sort of pressure** (Figure 33).



### Effective and impartial prosecution and pre-trial proceedings

- The average score for the expert indicator of **effective and impartial prosecution and pre-trial proceedings** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.60 (Figure 34). Country-level scores range from 0.76 in Finland to 0.43 in Bulgaria.
- In 20 Member States, the majority of respondents express a lot or some **trust in prosecutors in charge of criminal investigations**, and in 26 Member States, fewer than half of respondents believe that most or all **prosecutors are involved in corrupt practices** (Figure 35). Compared to other EU Member States, respondents in Bulgaria report the lowest levels of trust in prosecutors (31.2%) and the highest perception of corruption of prosecutors (60.0%).   
- In 12 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **the criminal justice system is effective in bringing people who commit crimes to justice**. At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree with this statement ranges from 67.9% in Finland to 23.4% in Slovakia (Figure 37). In 8 Member States, at least half of respondents agree that **crimes are prosecuted in an independent manner**. At the country level, the percentage of respondents who agree with this statement ranges from 71.2% in Finland to 18.1% in Slovakia (Figure 36).

### Alternative criminal justice mechanisms 

- The average score for the expert indicator of **alternative criminal justice mechanisms** among all Member States\* is 0.52 (Figure 41). Country-level scores range from 0.68 in Finland to 0.41 in Bulgaria.

- In just 6 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that the **criminal justice system provides victims of crime with the service and support they need** (Figure 46).

\*The finding on victims’ rights covers 25 out of the 27 EU Member States; this data was not collected in Denmark and Malta.

### Due process of law

- The average score for the expert indicator of the **due process of law** among the 27 EU Member States is 0.63 (Figure 47). Country-level scores range from 0.75 in Finland to 0.52 in Bulgaria.

- In 13 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that **public defenders do everything they can to defend poor people who are accused of committing a crime** (Figure 51). At the country level, the percentage of respondents that agree with this statement ranges from 61.9% in Spain to 28.9% in Slovenia.  
- In 26 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that the **basic rights of suspects are respected by the police**—with just below half (49.5%) of respondents agreeing the same Slovakia is the only Member State that does not meet this trend (Figure 49). In 20 Member States, the majority of respondents agree that members of the **police do not use excessive or unnecessary force** (Figure 50). 
- In 15 Member States, the majority of respondents are confident that the **criminal justice system allows equal access to a fair trial** (Figure 52), and in 17 Member States, the majority of respondents are confident that **the criminal justice system treats those accused of a crime as 'innocent until proven guilty'** (Figure 53). These perceptions are comparatively negative among Slovakian respondents, with just 26.7% reporting confidence in equal access to a fair trial and 28.0% reporting confidence in respect for the presumption of innocence.  


### Rights of persons deprived of liberty

- The average score for the expert indicator of respect for the **rights of persons deprived of liberty** among all the Member States\* is  0.66 (Figure 54). Country-level scores range from 0.83 in Luxembourg to 0.43 in Greece.
- In 16 Members States, the majority of respondents agree that the **criminal justice system guarantees the safety and human rights of people deprived of their liberty**, with country-level figures ranging from 72.9% of respondents in Luxembourg to 29.9% in Slovakia (Figure 55).

- Women are less likely than men  to feel safe in every Member State except Poland.
- Most people across the EU trust the police to **solve community safety problems and to treat everyone with respect**. However, respondents in Ireland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Cyprus hold comparatively negative views.
